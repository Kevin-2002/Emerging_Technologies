grumbled jo lying on the rug.  its so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress.  i dont think its fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured sniff.  weve got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner.  the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we havent got father and shall not have him for a long time. she didnt say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was.  nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army. we cant do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly. but i am afraid i dont and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.  but i dont think the little we should spend would do any good. weve each got a dollar and the army wouldnt be much helped by our giving that. i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintran for myself. ive wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm.  i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettleholder.  i shall get a nice box of fabers drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly.  mother didnt say anything about our money and she wont wish us to give up everything. lets each buy what we want and have a little fun im sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.  i know i doteaching those tiresome children nearly all day when im longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again.  you dont have half such a hard time as i do said jo. how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till youre ready to fly out the window or cry  its naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i cant practice well at all. and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.  i dont believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you dont have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you dont know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he isnt rich and insult you when your nose isnt nice.  if you mean libel id say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing.  i know what i mean and you neednt be statirical about it. its proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity.  dont peck at one another children. dont you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good wed be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times.  you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money.  so i did beth. well i think we are. for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say.  jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug.  jo immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle.  dont jo. its so boyish  thats why i do it.  i detest rude unladylike girls  i hate affected niminypiminy chits  birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time.  really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her eldersisterly fashion. you are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine. it didnt matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady.  im not and if turning up my hair makes me one ill wear it in two tails till im twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane. i hate to think ive got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster its bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like boys games and work and manners i cant get over my disappointment in not being a boy. and its worse than ever now for im dying to go and fight with papa. and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman  and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room.  poor jo its too bad but it cant be helped. so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch.  as for you amy continued meg you are altogether too particular and prim. your airs are funny now but youll grow up an affected little goose if you dont take care. i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you dont try to be elegant. but your absurd words are as bad as jos slang.  if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture.  youre a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family.  as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within. it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.  margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain. fifteenyearold jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way. she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful. her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way. round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didnt like it. elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smoothhaired brighteyed girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least. a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.  the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her. meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.  they are quite worn out. marmee must have a new pair.  i thought id get her some with my dollar said beth.  no i shall cried amy.  im the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided im the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone.  ill tell you what well do said beth lets each get her something for christmas and not get anything for ourselves.  thats like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo.  everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves.  army shoes best to be had cried jo.  some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth.  ill get a little bottle of cologne. she likes it and it wont cost much so ill have some left to buy my pencils added amy.  how will we give the things asked meg.  put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles. dont you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo.  i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss. i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.  let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her. we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg. there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.  i dont mean to act any more after this time. im getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about dressingup frolics.  you wont stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear goldpaper jewelry. you are the best actress weve got and therell be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo. we ought to rehearse tonight. come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that.  i cant help it. i never saw anyone faint and i dont choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do. if i can go down easily ill drop. if i cant i shall fall into a chair and be graceful. i dont care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.  do it this way. clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.  amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. its no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs dont blame me. come on meg.  then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break. hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect. roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha  its the best weve had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows.  i dont see how you can write and act such splendid things jo. youre a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.  not quite replied jo modestly. i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but id like to try macbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo. i always wanted to do the killing part. is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do.  no its the toasting fork with mothers shoe on it instead of the bread. beths stagestruck cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter.  glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful. she was not elegantly dressed but a noblelooking woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world.  well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i didnt come home to dinner. has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death. come and kiss me baby.  while making these maternal inquiries mrs. march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way. meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping overturning and clattering everything she touched. beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded.  as they gathered about the table mrs. march said with a particularly happy face ive got a treat for you after supper.  a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father  yes a nice long letter. he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs. march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.  hurry and get done dont stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.  beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready.  i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly.  dont i wish i could go as a drummer a vivanwhats its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan.  it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of badtasting things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy.  when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice.  not for many months dear unless he is sick. he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we wont ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. now come and hear the letter.  they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home. in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered. it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the writers heart overflow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.  give them all of my dear love and a kiss. tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted. i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women. everybody sniffed when they came to that part. jo wasnt ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mothers shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but ill truly try to be better so he maynt be disappointed in me byandby.  we all will cried meg. i think too much of my looks and hate to work but wont any more if i can help it.  ill try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south.  beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home.  mrs. march broke the silence that followed jos words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city.  what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the hobgoblins were said jo.  i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg.  i dont remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. if i wasnt too old for such things id rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.  we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. our burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city. now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home.  really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady.  each of you told what your burden was just now except beth. i rather think she hasnt got any said her mother.  yes i have. mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people.  beths bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much.  let us do it said meg thoughtfully. it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good its hard work and we forget and dont do our best.  we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book. we ought to have our roll of directions like christian. what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty.  look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs. march.  they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march. it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled. they adopted jos plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.  at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed. no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. meg had a voice like a flute and she and her mother led the little choir. amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. they had always done this from the time they could lisp...  crinkle crinkle ittle tar   and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer. the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby.     chapter two a merry christmas   jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning. no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. then she remembered her mothers promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little crimsoncovered book. she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow. a greencovered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes. presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also one dovecolored the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day.  in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.  girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little nightcapped ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once. we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things. you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day.  then she opened her new book and began to read. jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.  how good meg is come amy lets do as they do. ill help you with the hard words and theyll explain things if we dont understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example.  im glad mine is blue said amy. and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting.  where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later.  goodness only knows. some poor creeter came abeggin and your ma went straight off to see what was needed. there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.  she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time. why where is amys bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear.  she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.  how nice my handkerchiefs look dont they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.  bless the child shes gone and put mother on them instead of m. march. how funny cried jo taking one up.  isnt that right i thought it was better to do it so because megs initials are m.m. and i dont want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled.  its all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now. it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth.  theres mother. hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall.  amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her.  where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early.  dont laugh at me jo i didnt mean anyone should know till the time came. i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and im truly trying not to be selfish any more.  as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.  you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and im so glad for mine is the handsomest now.  another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast.  merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books. we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus.  merry christmas little daughters im glad you began at once and hope you will keep on. but i want to say one word before we sit down. not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire. there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present  they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously im so glad you came before we began  may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly.  i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked.  meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate.  i thought youd do it said mrs. march smiling as if satisfied. you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime.  they were soon ready and the procession set out. fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party.  a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm.  how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.  ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy.  funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing.  in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. mrs. march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english.  das ist gut die engelkinder cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born. that was a very happy breakfast though they didnt get any of it. and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning.  thats loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels.  not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table.  shes coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor.  beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity. mrs. march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with amys cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit.  there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work.  the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed. very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of oldfashioned butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.  no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her hearts content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor. these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were jos chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides. it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society.  on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment. presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began.  a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance. this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots. after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred for roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other. the gruff tones of hugos voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee  out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one to destroy roderigo. hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter.  hither hither from thy home airy sprite i bid thee come born of roses fed on dew charms and potions canst thou brew bring me here with elfin speed the fragrant philter which i need. make it sweet and swift and strong spirit answer now my song   a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head. waving a wand it sang...  hither i come from my airy home afar in the silver moon. take the magic spell and use it well or its power will vanish soon   and dropping a small gilded bottle at the witchs feet the spirit vanished. another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him. then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play.  a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay. it was truly superb. a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo. he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course. kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones. zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly. then came the grand effect of the play. roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend. timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on roderigos shoulder and was about to leap gracefully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train. it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins.  a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside...  dont laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. this dauntless example fired zara. she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made.  act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo. she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon. the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo. hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.  this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villains death. he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together.  act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him. just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will. a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love.  act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro. he wishes her to go into a convent but she wont hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand. don pedro refuses because he is not rich. they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared. the latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he doesnt make them happy. the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter. this entirely softens the stern sire. he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don pedros blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.  tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter. the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs. marchs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper.  this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty. there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers.  it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.  is it fairies asked amy.  santa claus said beth.  mother did it. and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows.  aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration.  all wrong. old mr. laurence sent it replied mrs. march.  the laurence boys grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we dont know him exclaimed meg.  hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him. he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day. i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breadandmilk breakfast.  that boy put it into his head i know he did hes a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted. he looks as if hed like to know us but hes bashful and meg is so prim she wont let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.  you mean the people who live in the big house next door dont you asked one of the girls. my mother knows old mr. laurence but says hes very proud and doesnt like to mix with his neighbors. he keeps his grandson shut up when he isnt riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard. we invited him to our party but he didnt come. mother says hes very nice though he never speaks to us girls.  our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off. i mean to know him some day for he needs fun im sure he does said jo decidedly.  i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so ive no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes. he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs. he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.  its a mercy you didnt mother laughed jo looking at her boots. but well have another play sometime that he can see. perhaps hell help act. wouldnt that be jolly  i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest.  they are lovely. but beths roses are sweeter to me said mrs. march smelling the halfdead posy in her belt.  beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father. im afraid he isnt having such a merry christmas as we are.     chapter three the laurence boy   jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs.  here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old threelegged sofa by the sunny window. this was jos favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didnt mind her a particle. as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole. jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.  such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs. gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.  mrs. gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new years eve. marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear  whats the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we havent got anything else answered jo with her mouth full.  if i only had a silk sighed meg. mother says i may when im eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait.  im sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us. yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine. whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i cant take any out.  you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. the front is all right. i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they arent as nice as id like.  mine are spoiled with lemonade and i cant get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress.  you must have gloves or i wont go cried meg decidedly. gloves are more important than anything else. you cant dance without them and if you dont i should be so mortified.  then ill stay still. i dont care much for company dancing. its no fun to go sailing round. i like to fly about and cut capers.  you cant ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless. she said when you spoiled the others that she shouldnt get you any more this winter. cant you make them do  i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are. thats all i can do. no ill tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one. dont you see  your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her.  then ill go without. i dont care what people say cried jo taking up her book.  you may have it you may only dont stain it and do behave nicely. dont put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you  dont worry about me. ill be as prim as i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it. now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story.  so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble.  on new years eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the allimportant business of getting ready for the party. simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.  ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed.  its the dampness drying replied jo.  what a queer smell its like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.  there now ill take off the papers and youll see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs.  she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.  oh oh oh what have you done im spoiled i cant go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.  just my luck you shouldnt have asked me to do it. i always spoil everything. im so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so ive made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret.  it isnt spoiled. just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion. ive seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly.  serves me right for trying to be fine. i wish id let my hair alone cried meg petulantly.  so do i it was so smooth and pretty. but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.  after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family jos hair was got up and her dress on. they looked very well in their simple suits megs in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin. jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine. megs highheeled slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and jos nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die.  have a good time dearies said mrs. march as the sisters went daintily down the walk. dont eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you. as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window...  girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs  yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.  it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own.  now dont forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo. is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs. gardiners dressing room after a prolonged prink.  i know i shall forget. if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.  no winking isnt ladylike. ill lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right. now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and dont shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. it isnt the thing.  how do you learn all the proper ways i never can. isnt that music gay  down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them. mrs. gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who didnt care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life. she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy.  dear me i didnt know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.  but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled dont mind me stay if you like.  shant i disturb you  not a bit. i only came here because i dont know many people and felt rather strange at first you know.  so did i. dont go away please unless youd rather.  the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think ive had the pleasure of seeing you before. you live near us dont you  next door. and he looked up and laughed outright for jos prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.  that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present.  grandpa sent it.  but you put it into his head didnt you now  how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun.  nicely thank you mr. laurence. but i am not miss march im only jo returned the young lady.  im not mr. laurence im only laurie.  laurie laurence what an odd name.  my first name is theodore but i dont like it for the fellows called me dora so i made them say laurie instead.  i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine. how did you make the boys stop calling you dora  i thrashed em.  i cant thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it. and jo resigned herself with a sigh.  dont you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her.  i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively. in a place like this im sure to upset something tread on peoples toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about. dont you dance  sometimes. you see ive been abroad a good many years and havent been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.  abroad cried jo. oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels.  laurie didnt seem to know where to begin but jos eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers.  dont i wish id been there cried jo. did you go to paris  we spent last winter there.  can you talk french  we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay.  do say some i can read it but cant pronounce.  quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis  how nicely you do it let me see ... you said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers didnt you  oui mademoiselle.  its my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty  yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady.  jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg. both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. lauries bashfulness soon wore off for jos gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.  curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly. wonder how old he is  it was on the tip of jos tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a roundabout way.  i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard. and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her.  laurie smiled but didnt seem shocked and answered with a shrug. not for a year or two. i wont go before seventeen anyway.  arent you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already.  sixteen next month.  how i wish i was going to college you dont look as if you liked it.  i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking. and i dont like the way fellows do either in this country.  what do you like  to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way.  jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time thats a splendid polka why dont you go and try it  if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow.  i cant for i told meg i wouldnt because... there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.  because what  you wont tell  never  well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though its nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. you may laugh if you want to. it is funny i know.  but laurie didnt laugh. he only looked down a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that. ill tell you how we can manage. theres a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us. please come.  jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice pearlcolored ones her partner wore. the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring. when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister. she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale.  ive sprained my ankle. that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. it aches so i can hardly stand and i dont know how im ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain.  i knew youd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. im sorry. but i dont see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.  i cant have a carriage without its costing ever so much. i dare say i cant get one at all for most people come in their own and its a long way to the stable and no one to send.  ill go.  no indeed its past nine and dark as egypt. i cant stop here for the house is full. sallie has some girls staying with her. ill rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can.  ill ask laurie. he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.  mercy no dont ask or tell anyone. get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things. i cant dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she comes.  they are going out to supper now. ill stay with you. id rather.  no dear run along and bring me some coffee. im so tired i cant stir.  so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr. gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.  oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing megs glove by scrubbing her gown with it.  can i help you said a friendly voice. and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.  i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffeecolored glove.  too bad i was looking for someone to give this to. may i take it to your sister  oh thank you ill show you where she is. i dont offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did.  jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy. they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or three other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared. meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain.  hush dont say anything she whispered adding aloud its nothing. i turned my foot a little thats all and limped upstairs to put her things on.  hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till she decided to take things into her own hands. slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage. it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his grandfathers carriage which had just come for him he said.  its so early you cant mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.  i always go early i do truly please let me take you home. its all on my way you know and it rains they say.  that settled it and telling him of megs mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant. laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom.  i had a capital time. did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable.  yes till i hurt myself. sallies friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does. she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought.  i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from. was he nice  oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him.  he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. laurie and i couldnt help laughing. did you hear us  no but it was very rude. what were you about all that time hidden away there  jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home. with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...  tell about the party tell about the party  with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.  i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair.  i dont believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them. and i think jo was quite right.     chapter four burdens   oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked.  i wish it was christmas or new years all the time. wouldnt it be fun answered jo yawning dismally.  we shouldnt enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work. its like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things im so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.  well we cant have it so dont let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does. im sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when ive learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i shant mind her.  this idea tickled jos fancy and put her in good spirits but meg didnt brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever. she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.  wheres the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether im pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk. i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because im poor and cant enjoy my life as other girls do. its a shame  so meg went down wearing an injured look and wasnt at all agreeable at breakfast time. everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak.  beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens. amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she couldnt find her rubbers. jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.  mrs. march was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and hannah had the grumps for being up late didnt suit her.  there never was such a cross family cried jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both boot lacings and sat down upon her hat.  youre the crossest person in it returned amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.  beth if you dont keep these horrid cats down cellar ill have them drowned exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.  jo laughed meg scolded beth implored and amy wailed because she couldnt remember how much nine times twelve was.  girls girls do be quiet one minute i must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried mrs. march crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.  there was a momentary lull broken by hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again. these turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.  hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak. the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.  cuddle your cats and get over your headache bethy. goodbye marmee. we are a set of rascals this morning but well come home regular angels. now then meg and jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.  they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them. somehow it seemed as if they couldnt have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.  if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.  dont use such dreadful expressions replied meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.  i like good strong words that mean something replied jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether.  call yourself any names you like but i am neither a rascal nor a wretch and i dont choose to be called so.  youre a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you cant sit in the lap of luxury all the time. poor dear just wait till i make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and highheeled slippers and posies and redheaded boys to dance with.  how ridiculous you are jo but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.  lucky for you i am for if i put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state. thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up. dont croak any more but come home jolly theres a dear.  jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of pleasureloving youth.  when mr. march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least. believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.  margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. as she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty. she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown. she tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life. at the kings she daily saw all she wanted for the childrens older sisters were just out and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theaters concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. poor meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.  jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined. other friends told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old ladys will but the unworldly marches only said...  we cant give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another.  the old lady wouldnt speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at a friends something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old ladys fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion. this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every ones surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. there was an occasional tempest and once jo marched home declaring she couldnt bear it longer but aunt march always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.  i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died. jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her.  the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm. but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called josyphine josyphine and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read belshams essays by the hour together.  jos ambition was to do something very splendid. what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldnt read run and ride as much as she liked. a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic. but the training she received at aunt marchs was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual josyphine  beth was too bashful to go to school. it had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father. even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved. long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee. there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly. beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed. one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge. having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed. she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope youll have a good night my poor dear.  beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she couldnt take music lessons and have a fine piano. she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint aunt march ought to help her. nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that wouldnt keep in tune when she was all alone. she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know ill get my music some time if im good.  there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind.  if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose. when she was a baby jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. it was not big nor red like poor petreas it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.  little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. she was a great favorite with her mates being goodtempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than twothirds of the words. she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did soandso which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls.  amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. one thing however rather quenched the vanities. she had to wear her cousins clothes. now florences mama hadnt a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit. everything was good well made and little worn but amys artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.  my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother doesnt take tucks in my dresses whenever im naughty as maria parkss mother does. my dear its really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she cant come to school. when i think of this deggerredation i feel that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it.  meg was amys confidant and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle beths. to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big harumscarum sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.  has anybody got anything to tell its been such a dismal day im really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening.  i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it ill tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories. i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up. i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.  i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy.  then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment. she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a topheavy dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt. id just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud. aunt woke up and being more goodnatured after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham. i did my very best and she liked it though she only said...  i dont understand what its all about. go back and begin it child.  back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could. once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly im afraid it tires you maam. shant i stop now  she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and dont be impertinent miss.  did she own she liked it asked meg.  oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she didnt hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose i dont envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo.  that reminds me said meg that ive got something to tell. it isnt funny like jos story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home. at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away. i heard mrs. king crying and mr. king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i shouldnt see how red and swollen their eyes were. i didnt ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i hadnt any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.  i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one. susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might. well she drew a picture of mr. davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate. she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the earthe ear just fancy how horridand led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half an hour holding the slate so everyone could see.  didnt the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape.  laugh not one they sat still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did. i didnt envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldnt have made me happy after that. i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification. and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.  i saw something i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting jos topsyturvy basket in order as she talked. when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr. laurence was in the fish shop but he didnt see me for i kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with mr. cutter the fishman. a poor woman came in with a pail and a mop and asked mr. cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she hadnt any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a days work. mr. cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr. laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over. he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy wasnt it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr. laurences bed in heaven would be aisy.  when they had laughed at beths story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him. it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious.  have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me.  yes maam. i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and im going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital. he answered quietly.  you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity.  not a mite more than i ought maam. id go myself if i was any use. as i aint i give my boys and give em free.  he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself. id given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them. i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say goodby to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.  tell another story mother one with a moral to it like this. i like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a minutes silence.  mrs. march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them.  once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented. here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently. these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if only we had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do. so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful. here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet.  being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were. one discovered that money couldnt keep shame and sorrow out of rich peoples houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who couldnt enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old womans advice.  now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg.  i like that kind of sermon. its the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on jos cushion.  i dont complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for ive had warning from susies downfall said amy morally.  we needed that lesson and we wont forget it. if we do so you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them.     chapter five being neighborly   what in the world are you going to do now jo asked meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.  going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.  i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough its cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver.  never take advice cant keep still all day and not being a pussycat i dont like to doze by the fire. i like adventures and im going to find some.  meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy. the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr. laurence. both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets. a low hedge parted the two estates. on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it. on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and wellkept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.  yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson.  to jos lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin. since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were snowballing one another.  that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself. his grandpa does not know whats good for him and keeps him shut up all alone. he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively. ive a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so  the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances. the plan of going over was not forgotten. and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done. she saw mr. lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey. all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.  there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day. its a shame ill toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him.  up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out...  how do you do are you sick  laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...  better thank you. ive had a bad cold and been shut up a week.  im sorry. what do you amuse yourself with  nothing. its dull as tombs up here.  dont you read  not much. they wont let me.  cant somebody read to you  grandpa does sometimes but my books dont interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time.  have someone come and see you then.  there isnt anyone id like to see. boys make such a row and my head is weak.  isnt there some nice girl whod read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse.  dont know any.  you know us began jo then laughed and stopped.  so i do will you come please cried laurie.  im not quiet and nice but ill come if mother will let me. ill go ask her. shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come.  with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her. laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs. march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying to tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat. presently there came a loud ring then a decided voice asking for mr. laurie and a surprisedlooking servant came running up to announce a young lady.  all right show her up its miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and beths three kittens in the other.  here i am bag and baggage she said briskly. mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you. meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting. i knew youd laugh at them but i couldnt refuse she was so anxious to do something.  it so happened that beths funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once.  that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blanc mange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of amys pet geranium.  it isnt anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. tell the girl to put it away for your tea. its so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. what a cozy room this is  it might be if it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i dont know how to make them mind. it worries me though.  ill right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed soand the things made straight on the mantelpiece soand the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit. now then youre fixed.  and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully...  how kind you are yes thats what it wanted. now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.  no i came to amuse you. shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.  thank you ive read all those and if you dont mind id rather talk answered laurie.  not a bit. ill talk all day if youll only set me going. beth says i never know when to stop.  is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest.  yes thats beth. shes my girl and a regular good one she is too.  the pretty one is meg and the curlyhaired one is amy i believe  how did you find that out  laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when im alone up here i cant help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times. i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. and when the lamps are lighted its like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother. her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i cant help watching it. i havent got any mother you know. and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.  the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to jos warm heart. she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him. her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...  well never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like. i just wish though instead of peeping youd come over and see us. mother is so splendid shed do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance. meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and wed have jolly times. wouldnt your grandpa let you  i think he would if your mother asked him. hes very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only hes afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more.  we are not strangers we are neighbors and you neednt think youd be a bother. we want to know you and ive been trying to do it this ever so long. we havent been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.  you see grandpa lives among his books and doesnt mind much what happens outside. mr. brooke my tutor doesnt stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can.  thats bad. you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then youll have plenty of friends and pleasant places to go to. never mind being bashful. it wont last long if you keep going.  laurie turned red again but wasnt offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.  do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased.  dont go to school im a businessmangirl i mean. i go to wait on my greataunt and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo.  laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it wasnt manners to make too many inquiries into peoples affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable.  jo liked his good breeding and didnt mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled.  laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter.  oh that does me no end of good. tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment.  much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. then they got to talking about books and to jos delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself.  if you like them so much come down and see ours. grandfather is out so you neednt be afraid said laurie getting up.  im not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head.  i dont believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met him in some of his moods.  the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy. and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted. it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.  what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the world she added impressively.  a fellow cant live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite.  before he could say more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me its your grandpa  well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked.  i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i dont know why i should be. marmee said i might come and i dont think youre any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door.  im a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged. im only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. it was so pleasant i couldnt bear to stop said laurie gratefully.  the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke.  would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie.  dont mind me. im happy as a cricket here answered jo.  laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way. she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly im sure now that i shouldnt be afraid of him for hes got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. he isnt as handsome as my grandfather but i like him.  thank you maam said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr. laurence.  poor jo blushed till she couldnt blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal. the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so youre not afraid of me hey  not much sir.  and you dont think me as handsome as your grandfather  not quite sir.  and ive got a tremendous will have i  i only said i thought so.  but you like me in spite of it  yes i do sir.  that answer pleased the old gentleman. he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod youve got your grandfathers spirit if you havent his face. he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend.  thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly.  what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put.  only trying to be neighborly sir. and jo told how her visit came about.  you think he needs cheering up a bit do you  yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps. we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we dont forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly.  tut tut tut that was the boys affair. how is the poor woman  doing nicely sir. and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.  just her fathers way of doing good. i shall come and see your mother some fine day. tell her so. theres the tea bell we have it early on the boys account. come down and go on being neighborly.  if youd like to have me sir.  shouldnt ask you if i didnt. and mr. laurence offered her his arm with oldfashioned courtesy.  what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.  hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.  i didnt know youd come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance.  thats evident by the way you racket downstairs. come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman. and having pulled the boys hair by way of a caress mr. laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo.  the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him. there was color light and life in the boys face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh.  shes right the lad is lonely. ill see what these little girls can do for him thought mr. laurence as he looked and listened. he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.  if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward. but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression. when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit. it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much.  they found mr. laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room but jos attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open.  do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression.  sometimes he answered modestly.  please do now. i want to hear it so i can tell beth.  wont you first  dont know how. too stupid to learn but i love music dearly.  so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and didnt put on any airs. she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue.  that will do that will do young lady. too many sugarplums are not good for him. his music isnt bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things. going well im much obliged to you and i hope youll come again. my respects to your mother. good night doctor jo.  he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him. when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss. he shook his head.  no it was me. he doesnt like to hear me play.  why not  ill tell you some day. john is going home with you as i cant.  no need of that. i am not a young lady and its only a step. take care of yourself wont you  yes but you will come again i hope  if you promise to come and see us after you are well.  i will.  good night laurie  good night jo good night  when all the afternoons adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. mrs. march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.  mother why didnt mr. laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition.  i am not sure but i think it was because his son lauries father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud. the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married. they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home. i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful. laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said.  dear me how romantic exclaimed meg.  how silly said jo. let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go.  thats why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose. italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental.  what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental.  i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him.  he meant the blanc mange i suppose.  how stupid you are child he meant you of course.  did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.  i never saw such a girl you dont know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.  i think they are great nonsense and ill thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun. lauries a nice boy and i like him and i wont have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. well all be good to him because he hasnt got any mother and he may come over and see us maynt he marmee  yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.  i dont call myself a child and im not in my teens yet observed amy. what do you say beth  i was thinking about our pilgrims progress answered beth who had not heard a word. how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful.  we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect.     chapter six beth finds the palace beautiful   the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions. old mr. laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth. the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs. marchs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.  all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring. every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls. with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simplehearted girls. never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr. brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches.  never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterward said the old gentleman. the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise. i suspect she is right and that ive been coddling the fellow as if id been his grandmother. let him do what he likes as long as he is happy. he cant get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs. march is doing more for him than we can.  what good times they had to be sure. such plays and tableaux such sleigh rides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her hearts content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style.  but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it. she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she never told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano. no persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr. laurences ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters. during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and told such charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated. at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr. laurence talked on about lauries lessons and teachers. and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs. march...  the boy neglects his music now and im glad of it for he was getting too fond of it. but the piano suffers for want of use. wouldnt some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know maam  beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. before mrs. march could reply mr. laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...  they neednt see or speak to anyone but run in at any time. for im shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine oclock.  here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. please tell the young ladies what i say and if they dont care to come why never mind. here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way...  oh sir they do care very very much  are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly.  im beth. i love it dearly and ill come if you are quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.  not a soul my dear. the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged to you.  how kind you are sir  beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed her saying in a tone few people ever heard...  i had a little girl once with eyes like these. god bless you my dear good day madam. and away he went in a great hurry.  beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not home. how blithely she sang that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the side door and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.  she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude.  after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. she never knew that mr. laurence opened his study door to hear the oldfashioned airs he liked. she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what isnt always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped. perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. at any rate she deserved both.  mother im going to work mr. laurence a pair of slippers. he is so kind to me i must thank him and i dont know any other way. can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his.  yes dear. it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him. the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs. march who took peculiar pleasure in granting beths requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.  after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun. a cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts. she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. then she wrote a short simple note and with lauries help got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.  when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen. all day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend. on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise. as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed...  heres a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it  oh beth hes sent you... began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window.  beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinet piano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a sign board to miss elizabeth march.  for me gasped beth holding onto jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.  yes all for you my precious isnt it splendid of him dont you think hes the dearest old man in the world heres the key in the letter. we didnt open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note.  you read it i cant i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in jos apron quite upset by her present.  jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first words she saw were...  miss march dear madam  how nice it sounds i wish someone would write to me so said amy who thought the oldfashioned address very elegant.  i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continues jo. heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver. i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost. with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant james laurence.  there beth thats an honor to be proud of im sure laurie told me how fond mr. laurence used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully. just think hes given you her piano. that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before.  see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green silk puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties.  your humble servant james laurence. only think of his writing that to you. ill tell the girls. theyll think its splendid said amy much impressed by the note.  try it honey. lets hear the sound of the baby pianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.  so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. it had evidently been newly tuned and put in applepie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.  youll have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the childs really going never entered her head.  yes i mean to. i guess ill go now before i get frightened thinking about it. and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door.  well i wish i may die if it aint the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head shed never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.  they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward. if you will believe me she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr. laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for... but she didnt finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.  if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman wouldnt have been more astonished. but he liked it. oh dear yes he liked it amazingly and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride. when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was.  when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with uplifted hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end.     chapter seven amys valley of humiliation   that boy is a perfect cyclops isnt he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed.  how dare you say so when hes got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend.  i didnt say anything about his eyes and i dont see why you need fire up when i admire his riding.  oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter.  you neednt be so rude its only a lapse of lingy as mr. davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin. i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear.  why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at amys second blunder.  i need it so much. im dreadfully in debt and it wont be my turn to have the rag money for a month.  in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober.  why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i cant pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop.  tell me all about it. are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls. and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important.  why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too. its nothing but limes now for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils bead rings paper dolls or something else at recess. if one girl likes another she gives her a lime. if shes mad with her she eats one before her face and doesnt offer even a suck. they treat by turns and ive had ever so many but havent returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know.  how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse.  a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you. dont you like limes  not much. you may have my share. heres the money. make it last as long as you can for it isnt very plenty you know.  oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocket money ill have a grand feast for i havent tasted a lime this week. i felt delicate about taking any as i couldnt return them and im actually suffering for one.  next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist brownpaper parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twentyfour delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot. mary kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. but amy had not forgotten miss snows cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other peoples limes and stuckup people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow girls hopes by the withering telegram you neednt be so polite all of a sudden for you wont get any.  a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and amys beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success. no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr. davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk.  now mr. davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law. this muchenduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr. blimber. mr. davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance. it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it. mr. davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear. the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.  young ladies attention if you please  at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.  miss march come to the desk.  amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience.  bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.  dont take all. whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind.  amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr. davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. unfortunately mr. davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath.  is that all  not quite stammered amy.  bring the rest immediately.  with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed.  you are sure there are no more  i never lie sir.  so i see. now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window.  there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips. scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes. thisthis was too much. all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.  as amy returned from her last trip mr. davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner...  young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago. i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word. miss march hold out your hand.  amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter. she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and its my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the culprits fate.  your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw back her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm. they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her. for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down.  you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr. davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun.  that was dreadful. it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying. a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.  during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before. the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me  the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before.  you can go miss march said mr. davis looking as he felt uncomfortable.  he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself. she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once. mrs. march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr. davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.  no notice was taken of amys flight except by her mates but the sharpeyed demoiselles discovered that mr. davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous. just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected amys property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.  yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs. march that evening. i dont approve of corporal punishment especially for girls. i dislike mr. daviss manner of teaching and dont think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your fathers advice before i send you anywhere else.  thats good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school. its perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr.  i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy.  do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy.  i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but im not sure that it wont do you more good than a bolder method. you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it. you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius. there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty.  so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo. i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she didnt know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and wouldnt have believed it if anyone had told her.  i wish id known that nice girl. maybe she would have helped me im so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly.  you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.  jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy  yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent. he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother.  and he isnt conceited is he asked amy.  not in the least. that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much.  i see. its nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully.  these things are always seen and felt in a persons manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs. march.  any more than its proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know youve got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh.     chapter eight jo meets apollyon   girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.  never mind. little girls shouldnt ask questions returned jo sharply.  now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us. amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour. turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i havent got anything to do and am so lonely.  i cant dear because you arent invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all. you cant go amy so dont be a baby and whine about it.  you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are. you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in. arent you going with him  yes we are. now do be still and stop bothering.  amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket.  i know i know youre going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and ive got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time.  just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly. mother doesnt wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time.  i dont like that half as well as going with you and laurie. please let me. ive been sick with this cold so long and shut up im dying for some fun. do meg ill be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could.  suppose we take her. i dont believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg.  if she goes i shant and if i dont laurie wont like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy. i should think shed hate to poke herself where she isnt wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.  her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go. meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie hasnt anything to do with it.  you cant sit with us for our seats are reserved and you mustnt sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure. or hell get another seat for you and that isnt proper when you werent asked. you shant stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry.  sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing. for now and then she forgot her grownup ways and acted like a spoiled child. just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone youll be sorry for this jo march see if you aint.  fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door.  they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses jos pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. the fairy queens yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it. she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward. although the oldest jo had the least selfcontrol and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble. her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better. her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.  when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor. she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question. perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play. on going up to put away her best hat jos first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning jos top drawer upside down on the floor. everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.  there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest. meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book  meg and beth said no. at once and looked surprised. amy poked the fire and said nothing. jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute.  amy youve got it  no i havent.  you know where it is then  no i dont.  thats a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy.  it isnt. i havent got it dont know where it is now and dont care.  you know something about it and youd better tell at once or ill make you. and jo gave her a slight shake.  scold as much as you like youll never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn.  why not  i burned it up.  what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously.  yes i did i told you id make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so...  amy got no farther for jos hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger...  you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and ill never forgive you as long as i live.  meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her sisters ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone.  the storm cleared up below for mrs. march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. jos book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise. it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print. she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that amys bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her. beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet. mrs. march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.  when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all amys courage to say meekly...  please forgive me jo. im very very sorry.  i never shall forgive you was jos stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely.  no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs. march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened jos resentment and healed the breach. it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed. they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone. but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune.  as jo received her goodnight kiss mrs. march whispered gently my dear dont let the sun go down upon your anger. forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow.  jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldnt quite forgive yet. so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she doesnt deserve to be forgiven.  with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night.  amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating. jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day. it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldnt even try when other people set them a virtuous example.  everybody is so hateful ill ask laurie to go skating. he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went.  amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation.  there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have. but its no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.  dont say that. you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg. go after them. dont say anything till jo has got goodnatured with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and im sure shell be friends again with all her heart.  ill try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill.  it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them. jo saw her coming and turned her back. laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.  ill go on to the first bend and see if its all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his furtrimmed coat and cap.  jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sisters troubles. she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. as laurie turned the bend he shouted back...  keep near the shore. it isnt safe in the middle. jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...  no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself.  laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river. for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made jos heart stand still with fear. she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone. she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a terrorstricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. something rushed swiftly by her and lauries voice cried out...  bring a rail. quick quick  how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite selfpossessed and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt.  now then we must walk her home as fast as we can. pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before.  shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire. during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs. march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.  are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice.  quite safe dear. she is not hurt and wont even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully.  laurie did it all. i only let her go. mother if she should die it would be my fault. and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.  its my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever. oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair.  watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs. march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder.  you dont know you cant guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when im in a passion. i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it. im afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me. oh mother help me do help me  i will my child i will. dont cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it. jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it.  yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise.  ive been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it. i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so.  the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof. she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her. the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.  mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.  yes ive learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs. march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up jos disheveled hair.  how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what im about and the more i say the worse i get till its a pleasure to hurt peoples feelings and say dreadful things. tell me how you do it marmee dear.  my good mother used to help me...  as you do us... interrupted jo with a grateful kiss.  but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on. then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good. but byandby when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.  poor mother what helped you then  your father jo. he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example. it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own. a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy.  oh mother if im ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched.  i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life. you have had a warning. remember it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.  i will try mother i truly will. but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out. i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away. was he reminding you then asked jo softly.  yes. i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.  jo saw that her mothers eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i didnt mean to be rude but its so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here.  my jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them.  i thought id grieved you.  no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.  yet you told him to go mother and didnt cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering.  i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone. why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i dont seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me. my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one. the more you love and trust him the nearer you will feel to him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but may become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength. believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.  jos only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words. for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of selfdenial and selfcontrol and led by her mothers hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother.  amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before.  i let the sun go down on my anger. i wouldnt forgive her and today if it hadnt been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.  as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to jos heart. neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.     chapter nine meg goes to vanity fair   i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters.  and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise. a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.  and such lovely weather im so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion.  i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her sisters cushion.  i wish you were all going but as you cant i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back. im sure its the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.  what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs. march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came.  a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash. i wanted the violet silk but there isnt time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlaton.   it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully. i wish i hadnt smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.  there is a lovely oldfashioned pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg. now let me see theres my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring doesnt it the violet silk would be so nice. oh dear  never mind youve got the tarlaton for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.  it isnt lownecked and it doesnt sweep enough but it will have to do. my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if id got a new one. my silk sacque isnt a bit the fashion and my bonnet doesnt look like sallies. i didnt like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. its strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside annies silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.  change it advised jo.  i wont be so silly or hurt marmees feelings when she took so much pains to get my things. its a nonsensical notion of mine and im not going to give up to it. my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. you are a dear to lend me yours jo. i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common. and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.  annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hannahs hands.  no i wouldnt for the smart caps wont match the plain gowns without any trimming on them. poor folks shouldnt rig said jo decidedly.  i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently.  you said the other day that youd be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie moffats observed beth in her quiet way.  so i did well i am happy and i wont fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants doesnt it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the halffilled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton which she called her ball dress with an important air.  the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. mrs. march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went. but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life.  the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease. perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself. it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could. the more she saw of annie moffats pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and muchinjured girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.  she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time. they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought. mr. moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs. moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done. everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned.  when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin wouldnt do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside sallies crisp new one. meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud. no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms. but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies. the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers. before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within.  its for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff.  they are for miss march the man said. and heres a note put in the maid holding it to meg.  what fun who are they from didnt know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.  the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.  oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.  feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention. somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs. moffat she saw a happy brighteyed face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didnt strike her as so very shabby now.  she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her hearts content. everyone was very kind and she had three compliments. annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice. major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr. moffat insisted on dancing with her because she didnt dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it. so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely. she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...  how old is he  sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice.  it would be a grand thing for one of those girls wouldnt it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them.  mrs. m. has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is. the girl evidently doesnt think of it yet said mrs. moffat.  she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. poor thing shed be so nice if she was only got up in style. do you think shed be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice.  shes proud but i dont believe shed mind for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got. she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one.  here megs partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard. for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs. m. has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlaton till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs. moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor mans daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.  poor meg had a restless night and got up heavyeyed unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once. they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air...  daisy dear ive sent an invitation to your friend mr. laurence for thursday. we should like to know him and its only a proper compliment to you.  meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but im afraid he wont come.  why not cherie asked miss belle.  hes too old.  my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara.  nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes.  you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing.  there isnt any laurie is only a little boy. and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover.  about your age nan said.  nearer my sister jos i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head.  its very nice of him to send you flowers isnt it said annie looking wise about nothing.  yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them. my mother and old mr. laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more.  its evident daisy isnt out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod.  quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug.  im going out to get some little matters for my girls. can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs. moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.  no thank you maam replied sallie. ive got my new pink silk for thursday and dont want a thing.  nor i... began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them.  what shall you wear asked sallie.  my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable.  why dont you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady.  i havent got any other. it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny... she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly...  not at all. where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isnt out yet theres no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for ive got a sweet blue silk laid away which ive outgrown and you shall wear it to please me wont you dear  you are very kind but i dont mind my old dress if you dont it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg.  now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. i admire to do it and youd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. i shant let anyone see you till you are done and then well burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone.  meg couldnt refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats.  on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady. they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled. they laced her into a skyblue dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror. a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. a cluster of tearose buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of highheeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.  mademoiselle is charmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture.  come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting.  as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty. her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.  while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up. take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and dont any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success.  you dont look a bit like yourself but you are very nice. im nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and youre quite french i assure you. let your flowers hang dont be so careful of them and be sure you dont trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself.  keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled. she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect. several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden. several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest. she heard mrs. moffat reply to one of them...  daisy marchfather a colonel in the armyone of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her.  dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs. moffats fibs. the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a sideache the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie. he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy.  silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head. i wont care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend.  im glad you came i was afraid you wouldnt. she said with her most grownup air.  jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone.  what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.  i shall say i didnt know you for you look so grownup and unlike yourself im quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button.  how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it. wouldnt jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.  yes i think she would returned laurie gravely.  dont you like me so asked meg.  no i dont was the blunt reply.  why not in an anxious tone.  he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.  i dont like fuss and feathers.  that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw.  feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color. as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother...  they are making a fool of that little girl. i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely. shes nothing but a doll tonight.  oh dear sighed meg. i wish id been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.  she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out...  please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me.  im afraid it will be too disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely.  not a bit of it im dying to do it. come ill be good. i dont like your gown but i do think you are just splendid. and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration.  meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt doesnt trip you up. its the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it.  pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of.  away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.  laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why.  wont i said laurie with alacrity.  please dont tell them at home about my dress tonight. they wont understand the joke and it will worry mother.  then why did you do it said lauries eyes so plainly that meg hastily added...  i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly ive been. but id rather do it myself. so youll not tell will you  i give you my word i wont only what shall i say when they ask me  just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time.  ill say the first with all my heart but how about the other you dont look as if you were having a good time. are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...  no not just now. dont think im horrid. i only wanted a little fun but this sort doesnt pay i find and im getting tired of it.  here comes ned moffat. what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.  he put his name down for three dances and i suppose hes coming for them. what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely.  he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.  youll have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that. i wouldnt meg your mother doesnt like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan.  im not meg tonight im a doll who does all sorts of crazy things. tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again she answered with an affected little laugh.  wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off illpleased at the change he saw in her.  meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did. after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture. but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.  remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun.  silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away.  this little bit of byplay excited annies curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadnt enjoyed herself as much as she expected. she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fortnights fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough.  it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time. home is a nice place though it isnt splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening.  im glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day. for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in childrens faces.  meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried. as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking beths stool leaned her elbows on her mothers knee saying bravely...  marmee i want to fess.  i thought so. what is it dear  shall i go away asked jo discreetly.  of course not. dont i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats.  we are prepared said mrs. march smiling but looking a little anxious.  i told you they dressed me up but i didnt tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashionplate. laurie thought i wasnt proper. i know he did though he didnt say so and one man called me a doll. i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me.  is that all asked jo as mrs. march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies.  no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg selfreproachfully.  there is something more i think. and mrs. march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly...  yes. its very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie.  then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into megs innocent mind.  well if that isnt the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly. why didnt you pop out and tell them so on the spot  i couldnt it was so embarrassing for me. i couldnt help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i didnt remember that i ought to go away.  just wait till i see annie moffat and ill show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff. the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because hes rich and may marry us byandby wont he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke.  if you tell laurie ill never forgive you she mustnt must she mother said meg looking distressed.  no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs. march gravely. i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly illbred and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg.  dont be sorry i wont let it hurt me. ill forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go. ill not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother. i know im a silly little girl and ill stay with you till im fit to take care of myself. but it is nice to be praised and admired and i cant help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession.  that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg.  margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort. and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow.  mother do you have plans as mrs. moffat said asked meg bashfully.  yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs. moffats i suspect. i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject. you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good.  jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs. march said in her serious yet cheery way...  i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good. to be admired loved and respected. to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send. to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience. it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting. money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for. id rather see you poor mens wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without selfrespect and peace.  poor girls dont stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg.  then well be old maids said jo stoutly.  right jo. better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs. march decidedly. dont be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so loveworthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. leave these things to time. make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not. one thing remember my girls. mother is always ready to be your confidant father to be your friend and both of us hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of our lives.  we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night.     chapter ten the p.c. and p.o.   as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts. the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. hannah used to say id know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters. megs had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it. jos bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments. this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed aunt cockletop and her family of chicks. beth had oldfashioned fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies. amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and morningglories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.  gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original. one of these was the p.c. for as secret societies were the fashion it was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club. with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big p.c. in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor. at seven oclock the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity. meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she couldnt was nathaniel winkle. pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they goodnaturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings. on one occasion mr. pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr. snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read   the pickwick portfolio   may     poets corner   anniversary ode   again we meet to celebrate     with badge and solemn rite our fiftysecond anniversary     in pickwick hall tonight.  we all are here in perfect health     none gone from our small band again we see each wellknown face     and press each friendly hand.  our pickwick always at his post     with reverence we greet as spectacles on nose he reads     our wellfilled weekly sheet.  although he suffers from a cold     we joy to hear him speak for words of wisdom from him fall     in spite of croak or squeak.  old sixfoot snodgrass looms on high     with elephantine grace and beams upon the company     with brown and jovial face.  poetic fire lights up his eye     he struggles gainst his lot. behold ambition on his brow     and on his nose a blot.  next our peaceful tupman comes     so rosy plump and sweet who chokes with laughter at the puns     and tumbles off his seat.  prim little winkle too is here     with every hair in place a model of propriety     though he hates to wash his face.  the year is gone we still unite     to joke and laugh and read and tread the path of literature     that doth to glory lead.  long may our paper prosper well     our club unbroken be and coming years their blessings pour     on the useful gay p. c..   a. snodgrass   the masked marriage a tale of venice   gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon. knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance. sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on. has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm.  yes is she not lovely though so sad  her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates.  by my faith i envy him. yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask. when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour.  tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance. the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel. instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus  my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. father we wait your services. all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over. then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation.  gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it.  now my children let the play end. unmask and receive my blessing.  but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty.  my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio. i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife.  the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage.  s. pickwick   why is the p. c. like the tower of babel it is full of unruly members.   the history of a squash   once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes. one day in october when they were ripe he picked one and took it to market. a grocerman bought and put it in his shop. that same morning a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress with a round face and snub nose went and bought it for her mother. she lugged it home cut it up and boiled it in the big pot mashed some of it with salt and butter for dinner. and to the rest she added a pint of milk two eggs four spoons of sugar nutmeg and some crackers put it in a deep dish and baked it till it was brown and nice and next day it was eaten by a family named march.   t. tupman   mr. pickwick sir     i address you upon the subject of sin the sinner i mean is a man     named winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and     sometimes wont write his piece in this fine paper i hope you will     pardon his badness and let him send a french fable because he cant     write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains     in future i will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some     work which will be all commy la fo that means all right i am in     haste as it is nearly school time.   yours respectably n. winkle   the above is a manly and handsome acknowledgment of past misdemeanors. if our young friend studied punctuation it would be well.   a sad accident   on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress. on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes. a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr. pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly. on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well.   ed.   the public bereavement   it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend mrs. snowball pat paw. this lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community.     when last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the butchers     cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms     basely stole her. weeks have passed but no trace of her has been     discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her     basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us     forever.   a sympathizing friend sends the following gem  a lament for s. b. pat paw   we mourn the loss of our little pet     and sigh oer her hapless fate for never more by the fire shell sit     nor play by the old green gate.  the little grave where her infant sleeps     is neath the chestnut tree. but oer her grave we may not weep     we know not where it may be.  her empty bed her idle ball     will never see her more no gentle tap no loving purr     is heard at the parlor door.  another cat comes after her mice     a cat with a dirty face but she does not hunt as our darling did     nor play with her airy grace.  her stealthy paws tread the very hall     where snowball used to play but she only spits at the dogs our pet     so gallantly drove away.  she is useful and mild and does her best     but she is not fair to see and we cannot give her your place dear     nor worship her as we worship thee.   a.s.   advertisements   miss oranthy bluggage the accomplished strongminded lecturer will deliver her famous lecture on woman and her position at pickwick hall next saturday evening

bethvery good. amymiddling.   as the president finished reading the paper which i beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr. snodgrass rose to make a proposition.  mr. president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new memberone who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice. i propose mr. theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p. c. come now do have him.  jos sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat.  well put it to a vote said the president. all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying aye.  a loud response from snodgrass followed to everybodys surprise by a timid one from beth.  contraryminded say no.  meg and amy were contraryminded and mr. winkle rose to say with great elegance we dont wish any boys they only joke and bounce about. this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper.  im afraid hell laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful.  up rose snodgrass very much in earnest. sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie wont do anything of the sort. he likes to write and hell give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental dont you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes.  this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind.  yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid. i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes.  this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly. now then vote again. everybody remember its our laurie and say aye cried snodgrass excitedly.  aye aye aye replied three voices at once.  good bless you now as theres nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member. and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.  you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy.  the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr. pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile. but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr. president and ladiesi beg pardon gentlemenallow me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club.  good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned.  my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing.  come now dont lay it all on yourself. you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly.  never mind what she says. im the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr. pickwick. but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club.  hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal.  go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly.  i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if i may be allowed the expression. its the old martin house but ive stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time. letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy. allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat.  great applause as mr. weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored. a long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best. so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.  no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted wellbehaved and jovial member no club could have. he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental. jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought.  the p. o. was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office. tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies. the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with hannahs charms actually sent a love letter to jos care. how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come.     chapter eleven experiments   the first of june the kings are off to the seashore tomorrow and im free. three months vacationhow i shall enjoy it exclaimed meg coming home one warm day to find jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion while beth took off her dusty boots and amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.  aunt march went today for which oh be joyful said jo. i was mortally afraid shed ask me to go with her. if she had i should have felt as if i ought to do it but plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard you know and id rather be excused. we had a flurry getting the old lady off and i had a fright every time she spoke to me for i was in such a hurry to be through that i was uncommonly helpful and sweet and feared shed find it impossible to part from me. i quaked till she was fairly in the carriage and had a final fright for as it drove of she popped out her head saying josyphine wont you i didnt hear any more for i basely turned and fled. i did actually run and whisked round the corner where i felt safe.  poor old jo she came in looking as if bears were after her said beth as she cuddled her sisters feet with a motherly air.  aunt march is a regular samphire is she not observed amy tasting her mixture critically.  she means vampire not seaweed but it doesnt matter. its too warm to be particular about ones parts of speech murmured jo.  what shall you do all your vacation asked amy changing the subject with tact.  i shall lie abed late and do nothing replied meg from the depths of the rocking chair. ive been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people so now im going to rest and revel to my hearts content.  no said jo that dozy way wouldnt suit me. ive laid in a heap of books and im going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree when im not having l  dont say larks implored amy as a return snub for the samphire correction.  ill say nightingales then with laurie. thats proper and appropriate since hes a warbler.  dont let us do any lessons beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed amy.  well i will if mother doesnt mind. i want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer. they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.  may we mother asked meg turning to mrs. march who sat sewing in what they called marmees corner.  you may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.  oh dear no it will be delicious im sure said meg complacently.  i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says. fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round.  they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. next morning meg did not appear till ten oclock. her solitary breakfast did not taste good and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and amys books lay scattered about. nothing was neat and pleasant but marmees corner which looked as usual. and there meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree. beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment topsyturvy and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. as no one appeared but an inquisitive daddylonglegs who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping.  at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day. meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wouldnt wash which mishap made her slightly cross. jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long. beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy browns party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear. but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely. she smiled said nothing and with hannahs help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process. the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers an unsettled feeling possessed everyone and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la moffat. jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even goodnatured laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march. beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then. but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright. amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden. she didnt like dolls fairy tales were childish and one couldnt draw all the time. tea parties didnt amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted. if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grownup boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui.  no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done. hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs. march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.  when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen.  mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay.  meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed.  mother isnt sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can. its a very queer thing for her to do she doesnt act a bit like herself. but she says it has been a hard week for her so we mustnt grumble but take care of ourselves.  thats easy enough and i like the idea im aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added jo quickly.  in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of hannahs saying housekeeping aint no joke. there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.  i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for shed take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.  so a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the cooks compliments. the boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs. march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone.  poor little souls they will have a hard time im afraid but they wont suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful.  many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures. never mind ill get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs.  this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner.  youd better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act.  oh theres corned beef and plenty of potatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says. well have lettuce and make a salad. i dont know how but the book tells. ill have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant.  dont try too many messes jo for you cant make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. i wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him.  i dont want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. youll give me your advice if i get in a muddle wont you asked jo rather hurt.  yes but i dont know much except about bread and a few trifles. you had better ask mothers leave before you order anything returned meg prudently.  of course i shall. im not a fool. and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.  get what you like and dont disturb me. im going out to dinner and cant worry about things at home said mrs. march when jo spoke to her. i never enjoyed housekeeping and im going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself.  the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.  everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs. theres beth crying thats a sure sign that something is wrong in this family. if amy is bothering ill shake her.  feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died.  its all my fault i forgot him there isnt a seed or a drop left. oh pip oh pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.  jo peeped into his halfopen eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin.  put him in the oven and maybe he will get warm and revive said amy hopefully.  hes been starved and he shant be baked now hes dead. ill make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and ill never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.  the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go. now dont cry bethy. its a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment. make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party well have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.  leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out.  heres a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders.  having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated. the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargains she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries. by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was redhot. hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it. meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly...  i say isnt bread riz enough when it runs over the pans  sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. mrs. march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said shed come to dinner. now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions criticized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew.  language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. she boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. the bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last. the blanc mange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed.  well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only its mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.  poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. jos one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily. jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately.  oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling.  salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture.  jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator. she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met lauries eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts. the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. so did everyone else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun.  i havent strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another friends dinner table.  they did sober themselves for beths sake. laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his tenderhearted mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner.  here lies pip march who died the th of june loved and lamented sore and not forgotten soon.   at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.  laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. mrs. march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment.  before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them. then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute. as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled.  what a dreadful day this has been began jo usually the first to speak.  it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg.  not a bit like home added amy.  it cant seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.  heres mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it.  as she spoke mrs. march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.  are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun.  i dont cried jo decidedly.  nor i echoed the others.  you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you  lounging and larking doesnt pay observed jo shaking her head. im tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.  suppose you learn plain cooking. thats a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs. march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of jos dinner party for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it.  mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how wed get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day.  yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i dont think you were very happy or amiable. so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. dont you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all  we do mother we do cried the girls.  then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them. work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone. it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.  well work like bees and love it too see if we dont said jo. ill learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the next dinner party i have shall be a success.  ill make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee. i can and i will though im not fond of sewing. that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are. said meg.  ill do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was beths resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech.  very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only dont go to the other extreme and delve like slaves. have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty.  well remember mother and they did.     chapter twelve camp laurence   beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail. one july day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.  heres your posy mother laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in marmees corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.  miss meg march one letter and a glove continued beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands.  why i left a pair over there and here is only one said meg looking at the gray cotton glove. didnt you drop the other in the garden  no im sure i didnt for there was only one in the office.  i hate to have odd gloves never mind the other may be found. my letter is only a translation of the german song i wanted. i think mr. brooke did it for this isnt lauries writing.  mrs. march glanced at meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mothers mind as she sewed and sang while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that mrs. march smiled and was satisfied.  two letters for doctor jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole post office and stuck outside said beth laughing as she went into the study where jo sat writing.  what a sly fellow laurie is i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day. he said why mind the fashion wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me. ill wear it for fun and show him i dont care for the fashion. and hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of plato jo read her letters.  one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her...  my dear   i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper. you say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the friend whose help you daily ask if i may trust the wellworn cover of your guidebook. i too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit. go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...   mother   that does me good thats worth millions of money and pecks of praise. oh marmee i do try i will keep on trying and not get tired since i have you to help me.  laying her head on her arms jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued. feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news. in a big dashing hand laurie wrote...  dear jo what ho   some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time. if its fine im going to pitch my tent in longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquethave a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks. they are nice people and like such things. brooke will go to keep us boys steady and kate vaughn will play propriety for the girls. i want you all to come cant let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her. dont bother about rations ill see to that and everything else only do come theres a good fellow   in a tearing hurry yours ever laurie.   heres richness cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg.  of course we can go mother it will be such a help to laurie for i can row and meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way.  i hope the vaughns are not fine grownup people. do you know anything about them jo asked meg.  only that there are four of them. kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten. laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys. i fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he didnt admire kate much.  im so glad my french print is clean its just the thing and so becoming observed meg complacently. have you anything decent jo  scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me. i shall row and tramp about so i dont want any starch to think of. youll come betty  if you wont let any boys talk to me.  not a boy  i like to please laurie and im not afraid of mr. brooke he is so kind. but i dont want to play or sing or say anything. ill work hard and not trouble anyone and youll take care of me jo so ill go.  thats my good girl. you do try to fight off your shyness and i love you for it. fighting faults isnt easy as i know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift. thank you mother and jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to mrs. march than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.  i had a box of chocolate drops and the picture i wanted to copy said amy showing her mail.  and i got a note from mr. laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and i shall go added beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.  now lets fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom.  when the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight. each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream beth had taken joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. it was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put. this funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at amys ornament.  sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses. beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.  there goes the man with the tent i see mrs. barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. now mr. laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock. i wish he would go too. theres laurie looking like a sailor nice boy oh mercy me heres a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys. one is lame poor thing hes got a crutch. laurie didnt tell us that. be quick girls its getting late. why there is ned moffat i do declare. meg isnt that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping  so it is. how queer that he should come. i thought he was at the mountains. there is sallie. im glad she got back in time. am i all right jo cried meg in a flutter.  a regular daisy. hold up your dress and put your hat on straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. now then come on  oh jo you are not going to wear that awful hat its too absurd you shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated meg as jo tied down with a red ribbon the broadbrimmed oldfashioned leghorn laurie had sent for a joke.  i just will though for its capital so shady light and big. it will make fun and i dont mind being a guy if im comfortable. with that jo marched straight away and the rest followed a bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.  laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. the lawn was the reception room and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there. meg was grateful to see that miss kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which american girls would do well to imitate and who was much flattered by mr. neds assurances that he came especially to see her. jo understood why laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of kate for that young lady had a standoffdonttouchme air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account. amy found grace a wellmannered merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends.  tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving mr. laurence waving his hat on the shore. laurie and jo rowed one boat mr. brooke and ned the other while fred vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug. jos funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility. it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said. miss kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar.  meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity. mr. brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. he never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume. he was not very wise but very goodnatured and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. sallie gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous fred who kept beth in constant terror by his pranks.  it was not far to longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived. a pleasant green field with three widespreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet.  welcome to camp laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight.  brooke is commander in chief i am commissary general the other fellows are staff officers and you ladies are company. the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. now lets have a game before it gets hot and then well see about dinner.  frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. mr. brooke chose meg kate and fred. laurie took sallie jo and ned. the english played well but the americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of  inspired them. jo and fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal. fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. he gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side. no one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side.  im through now miss jo ill settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow.  you pushed it. i saw you. its my turn now said jo sharply.  upon my word i didnt move it. it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed. so stand off please and let me have a go at the stake.  we dont cheat in america but you can if you choose said jo angrily.  yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows. there you go returned fred croqueting her ball far away.  jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation. she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she came back looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently. it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for kates ball was the last but one and lay near the stake.  by george its all up with us goodbye kate. miss jo owes me one so you are finished cried fred excitedly as they all drew near to see the finish.  yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies said jo with a look that made the lad redden especially when they beat them she added as leaving kates ball untouched she won the game by a clever stroke.  laurie threw up his hat then remembered that it wouldnt do to exult over the defeat of his guests and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend good for you jo he did cheat i saw him. we cant tell him so but he wont do it again take my word for it.  meg drew her aside under pretense of pinning up a loose braid and said approvingly it was dreadfully provoking but you kept your temper and im so glad jo.  dont praise me meg for i could box his ears this minute. i should certainly have boiled over if i hadnt stayed among the nettles till i got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. its simmering now so i hope hell keep out of my way returned jo biting her lips as she glowered at fred from under her big hat.  time for lunch said mr. brooke looking at his watch. commissary general will you make the fire and get water while miss march miss sallie and i spread the table who can make good coffee  jo can said meg glad to recommend her sister. so jo feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor went to preside over the coffeepot while the children collected dry sticks and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. miss kate sketched and frank talked to beth who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.  the commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables prettily decorated with green leaves. jo announced that the coffee was ready and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal for youth is seldom dyspeptic and exercise develops wholesome appetites. a very merry lunch it was for everything seemed fresh and funny and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by. there was a pleasing inequality in the table which produced many mishaps to cups and plates acorns dropped in the milk little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. three whiteheaded children peeped over the fence and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main.  theres salt here said laurie as he handed jo a saucer of berries.  thank you i prefer spiders she replied fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. how dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party when yours is so nice in every way added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short.  i had an uncommonly good time that day and havent got over it yet. this is no credit to me you know i dont do anything. its you and meg and brooke who make it all go and im no end obliged to you. what shall we do when we cant eat anymore asked laurie feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over.  have games till its cooler. i brought authors and i dare say miss kate knows something new and nice. go and ask her. shes company and you ought to stay with her more.  arent you company too i thought shed suit brooke but he keeps talking to meg and kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers. im going so you neednt try to preach propriety for you cant do it jo.  miss kate did know several new games and as the girls would not and the boys could not eat any more they all adjourned to the drawing room to play rigmarole.  one person begins a story any nonsense you like and tells as long as he pleases only taking care to stop short at some exciting point when the next takes it up and does the same. its very funny when well done and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. please start it mr. brooke said kate with a commanding air which surprised meg who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.  lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies mr. brooke obediently began the story with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.  once on a time a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. he traveled a long while nearly eightandtwenty years and had a hard time of it till he came to the palace of a good old king who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt of which he was very fond. the knight agreed to try and got on slowly but surely for the colt was a gallant fellow and soon learned to love his new master though he was freakish and wild. every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the kings the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found. one day as he went prancing down a quiet street he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face. he was delighted inquired who lived in this old castle and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. the knight wished intensely that he could free them but he was poor and could only go by each day watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. he went and knocked. the great door flew open and he beheld...  a ravishingly lovely lady who exclaimed with a cry of rapture at last at last continued kate who had read french novels and admired the style. tis she cried count gustave and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. oh rise she said extending a hand of marble fairness. never till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling. alas my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed. where is the villain in the mauve salon. go brave heart and save me from despair. i obey and return victorious or dead with these thrilling words he rushed away and flinging open the door of the mauve salon was about to enter when he received...  a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him said ned. instantly sir whatshisname recovered himself pitched the tyrant out of the window and turned to join the lady victorious but with a bump on his brow found the door locked tore up the curtains made a rope ladder got halfway down when the ladder broke and he went headfirst into the moat sixty feet below. could swim like a duck paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts then by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength he smashed in the door went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick toads as big as your fist and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics miss march. at the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood...  a tall figure all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand went on meg. it beckoned gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side a dead silence reigned the lamp burned blue and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil. they reached a curtained door behind which sounded lovely music. he sprang forward to enter but the specter plucked him back and waved threateningly before him a...  snuffbox said jo in a sepulchral tone which convulsed the audience. thankee said the knight politely as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. ha ha laughed the ghost and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads like sardines who all rose and began to...  dance a hornpipe cut in fred as jo paused for breath and as they danced the rubbishy old castle turned to a manofwar in full sail. up with the jib reef the topsl halliards helm hard alee and man the guns roared the captain as a portuguese pirate hove in sight with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. go in and win my hearties says the captain and a tremendous fight began. of course the british beatthey always do.  no they dont cried jo aside.  having taken the pirate captain prisoner sailed slap over the schooner whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood for the order had been cutlasses and die hard bosuns mate take a bight of the flyingjib sheet and start this villain if he doesnt confess his sins double quick said the british captain. the portuguese held his tongue like a brick and walked the plank while the jolly tars cheered like mad. but the sly dog dived came up under the manofwar scuttled her and down she went with all sail set to the bottom of the sea sea sea where...  oh gracious what shall i say cried sallie as fred ended his rigmarole in which he had jumbled together pellmell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. well they went to the bottom and a nice mermaid welcomed them but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights and kindly pickled them in brine hoping to discover the mystery about them for being a woman she was curious. byandby a diver came down and the mermaid said ill give you a box of pearls if you can take it up for she wanted to restore the poor things to life and couldnt raise the heavy load herself. so the diver hoisted it up and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. he left it in a great lonely field where it was found by a...  little goose girl who kept a hundred fat geese in the field said amy when sallies invention gave out. the little girl was sorry for them and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. your geese will tell you they know everything. said the old woman. so she asked what she should use for new heads since the old ones were lost and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...  cabbages continued laurie promptly. just the thing said the girl and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. she put them on the knights revived at once thanked her and went on their way rejoicing never knowing the difference for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. the knight in whom im interested went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married but one. he was in a great state of mind at that and mounting the colt who stood by him through thick and thin rushed to the castle to see which was left. peeping over the hedge he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden. will you give me a rose said he. you must come and get it. i cant come to you it isnt proper said she as sweet as honey. he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher. then he tried to push through but it grew thicker and thicker and he was in despair. so he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped saying imploringly let me in let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in. whether he did or not frank will tell you.  i cant. im not playing i never do said frank dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple. beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep.  so the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge is he asked mr. brooke still watching the river and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole.  i guess the princess gave him a posy and opened the gate after a while said laurie smiling to himself as he threw acorns at his tutor.  what a piece of nonsense we have made with practice we might do something quite clever. do you know truth  i hope so said meg soberly.  the game i mean  what is it said fred.  why you pile up your hands choose a number and draw out in turn and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest. its great fun.  lets try it said jo who liked new experiments.  miss kate and mr. brooke meg and ned declined but fred sallie jo and laurie piled and drew and the lot fell to laurie.  who are your heroes asked jo.  grandfather and napoleon.  which lady here do you think prettiest said sallie.  margaret.  which do you like best from fred.  jo of course.  what silly questions you ask and jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at lauries matteroffact tone.  try again. truth isnt a bad game said fred.  its a very good one for you retorted jo in a low voice. her turn came next.  what is your greatest fault asked fred by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself.  a quick temper.  what do you most wish for said laurie.  a pair of boot lacings returned jo guessing and defeating his purpose.  not a true answer. you must say what you really do want most.  genius. dont you wish you could give it to me laurie and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.  what virtues do you most admire in a man asked sallie.  courage and honesty.  now my turn said fred as his hand came last.  lets give it to him whispered laurie to jo who nodded and asked at once...  didnt you cheat at croquet  well yes a little bit.  good didnt you take your story out of the sea lion said laurie.  rather.  dont you think the english nation perfect in every respect asked sallie.  i should be ashamed of myself if i didnt.  hes a true john bull. now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw. ill harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you dont think you are something of a flirt said laurie as jo nodded to fred as a sign that peace was declared.  you impertinent boy of course im not exclaimed sallie with an air that proved the contrary.  what do you hate most asked fred.  spiders and rice pudding.  what do you like best asked jo.  dancing and french gloves.  well i think truth is a very silly play. lets have a sensible game of authors to refresh our minds proposed jo.  ned frank and the little girls joined in this and while it went on the three elders sat apart talking. miss kate took out her sketch again and margaret watched her while mr. brooke lay on the grass with a book which he did not read.  how beautifully you do it i wish i could draw said meg with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.  why dont you learn i should think you had taste and talent for it replied miss kate graciously.  i havent time.  your mamma prefers other accomplishments i fancy. so did mine but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately and then she was quite willing i should go on. cant you do the same with your governess  i have none.  i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us. very fine schools they are too papa says. you go to a private one i suppose  i dont go at all. i am a governess myself.  oh indeed said miss kate but she might as well have said dear me how dreadful for her tone implied it and something in her face made meg color and wish she had not been so frank.  mr. brooke looked up and said quickly young ladies in america love independence as much as their ancestors did and are admired and respected for supporting themselves.  oh yes of course its very nice and proper in them to do so. we have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility because being the daughters of gentlemen they are both well bred and accomplished you know said miss kate in a patronizing tone that hurt megs pride and made her work seem not only more distasteful but degrading.  did the german song suit miss march inquired mr. brooke breaking an awkward pause.  oh yes it was very sweet and im much obliged to whoever translated it for me. and megs downcast face brightened as she spoke.  dont you read german asked miss kate with a look of surprise.  not very well. my father who taught me is away and i dont get on very fast alone for ive no one to correct my pronunciation.  try a little now. here is schillers mary stuart and a tutor who loves to teach. and mr. brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile.  its so hard im afraid to try said meg grateful but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.  ill read a bit to encourage you. and miss kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner.  mr. brooke made no comment as she returned the book to meg who said innocently i thought it was poetry.  some of it is. try this passage.  there was a queer smile about mr. brookes mouth as he opened at poor marys lament.  meg obediently following the long grassblade which her new tutor used to point with read slowly and timidly unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. down the page went the green guide and presently forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene meg read as if alone giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her.  very well indeed said mr. brooke as she paused quite ignoring her many mistakes and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.  miss kate put up her glass and having taken a survey of the little tableau before her shut her sketch book saying with condescension youve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. i advise you to learn for german is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. i must look after grace she is romping. and miss kate strolled away adding to herself with a shrug i didnt come to chaperone a governess though she is young and pretty. what odd people these yankees are. im afraid laurie will be quite spoiled among them.  i forgot that english people rather turn up their noses at governesses and dont treat them as we do said meg looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.  tutors also have rather a hard time of it there as i know to my sorrow. theres no place like america for us workers miss margaret. and mr. brooke looked so contented and cheerful that meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.  im glad i live in it then. i dont like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i wont complain. i only wished i liked teaching as you do.  i think you would if you had laurie for a pupil. i shall be very sorry to lose him next year said mr. brooke busily punching holes in the turf.  going to college i suppose megs lips asked the question but her eyes added and what becomes of you  yes its high time he went for he is ready and as soon as he is off i shall turn soldier. i am needed.  i am glad of that exclaimed meg. i should think every young man would want to go though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home she added sorrowfully.  i have neither and very few friends to care whether i live or die said mr. brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up like a little grave.  laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you said meg heartily.  thank you that sounds pleasant began mr. brooke looking cheerful again but before he could finish his speech ned mounted on the old horse came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies and there was no more quiet that day.  dont you love to ride asked grace of amy as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others led by ned.  i dote upon it. my sister meg used to ride when papa was rich but we dont keep any horses now except ellen tree added amy laughing.  tell me about ellen tree. is it a donkey asked grace curiously.  why you see jo is crazy about horses and so am i but weve only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch so jo put the saddle on it fixed some reins on the part that turns up and we bounce away on ellen tree whenever we like.  how funny laughed grace. i have a pony at home and ride nearly every day in the park with fred and kate. its very nice for my friends go too and the row is full of ladies and gentlemen.  dear how charming i hope i shall go abroad some day but id rather go to rome than the row said amy who had not the remotest idea what the row was and wouldnt have asked for the world.  frank sitting just behind the little girls heard what they were saying and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics. beth who was collecting the scattered author cards looked up and said in her shy yet friendly way im afraid you are tired. can i do anything for you  talk to me please. its dull sitting by myself answered frank who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.  if he asked her to deliver a latin oration it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth but there was no place to run to no jo to hide behind now and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.  what do you like to talk about she asked fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.  well i like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting said frank who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.  my heart what shall i do i dont know anything about them thought beth and forgetting the boys misfortune in her flurry she said hoping to make him talk i never saw any hunting but i suppose you know all about it.  i did once but i can never hunt again for i got hurt leaping a confounded fivebarred gate so there are no more horses and hounds for me said frank with a sigh that made beth hate herself for her innocent blunder.  your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes she said turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys books in which jo delighted.  buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory and in her eagerness to amuse another beth forgot herself and was quite unconscious of her sisters surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys against whom she had begged protection.  bless her heart she pities him so she is good to him said jo beaming at her from the croquet ground.  i always said she was a little saint added meg as if there could be no further doubt of it.  i havent heard frank laugh so much for ever so long said grace to amy as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.  my sister beth is a very fastidious girl when she likes to be said amy well pleased at beths success. she meant facinating but as grace didnt know the exact meaning of either word fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.  an impromptu circus fox and geese and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon. at sunset the tent was struck hampers packed wickets pulled up boats loaded and the whole party floated down the river singing at the tops of their voices. ned getting sentimental warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...  alone alone ah woe alone   and at the lines...  we each are young we each have a heart oh why should we stand thus coldly apart   he looked at meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.  how can you be so cruel to me he whispered under cover of a lively chorus. youve kept close to that starchedup englishwoman all day and now you snub me.  i didnt mean to but you looked so funny i really couldnt help it replied meg passing over the first part of his reproach for it was quite true that she had shunned him remembering the moffat party and the talk after it.  ned was offended and turned to sallie for consolation saying to her rather pettishly there isnt a bit of flirt in that girl is there  not a particle but shes a dear returned sallie defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.  shes not a stricken deer anyway said ned trying to be witty and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.  on the lawn where it had gathered the little party separated with cordial good nights and goodbyes for the vaughns were going to canada. as the four sisters went home through the garden miss kate looked after them saying without the patronizing tone in her voice in spite of their demonstrative manners american girls are very nice when one knows them.  i quite agree with you said mr. brooke.     chapter thirteen castles in the air   laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out. he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again. the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr. brookes patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. staring up into the green gloom of the horsechestnut trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition.  what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff. meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio. all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.  well thats cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they cant be going in the boat for they havent got the key. perhaps they forgot it. ill take it to them and see whats going on.  though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation. a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.  heres a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking wideawake and goodnatured already.  it was a rather pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things with them. amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud. a shadow passed over the boys face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit. he stood so still that a squirrel busy with its harvesting ran down a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile.  may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly.  meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may. we should have asked you before only we thought you wouldnt care for such a girls game as this.  i always like your games but if meg doesnt want me ill go away.  ive no objection if you do something. its against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously.  much obliged. ill do anything if youll let me stop a bit for its as dull as the desert of sahara down there. shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears. im ready. and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.  finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book.  yesm. was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the busy bee society.  the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.  please maam could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one  would you tell him asked meg of her sisters.  hell laugh said amy warningly.  who cares said jo.  i guess hell like it added beth.  of course i shall i give you my word i wont laugh. tell away jo and dont be afraid.  the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play pilgrims progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer.  yes i know said laurie nodding wisely.  who told you demanded jo.  spirits.  no i did. i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal. he did like it so dont scold jo said beth meekly.  you cant keep a secret. never mind it saves trouble now.  go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased.  oh didnt she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we didnt dawdle.  yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days.  mother likes to have us outofdoors as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times. for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago. we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time.  jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. the sun was low and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city.  how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind.  its often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it.  jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometimethe real country she means with pigs and chickens and haymaking. it would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly.  there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go byandby when we are good enough answered meg with her sweetest voice.  it seems so long to wait so hard to do. i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate.  youll get there beth sooner or later no fear of that said jo. im the one that will have to fight and work and climb and wait and maybe never get in after all.  youll have me for company if thats any comfort. i shall have to do a deal of traveling before i come in sight of your celestial city. if i arrive late youll say a good word for me wont you beth  something in the boys face troubled his little friend but she said cheerfully with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds if people really want to go and really try all their lives i think they will get in for i dont believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate. i always imagine it is as it is in the picture where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river.  wouldnt it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them said jo after a little pause.  ive made such quantities it would be hard to choose which id have said laurie lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.  youd have to take your favorite one. what is it asked meg.  if i tell mine will you tell yours  yes if the girls will too.  we will. now laurie.  after id seen as much of the world as i want to id like to settle in germany and have just as much music as i choose. im to be a famous musician myself and all creation is to rush to hear me. and im never to be bothered about money or business but just enjoy myself and live for what i like. thats my favorite castle. whats yours meg  margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers and waved a brake before her face as if to disperse imaginary gnats while she said slowly i should like a lovely house full of all sorts of luxurious thingsnice food pretty clothes handsome furniture pleasant people and heaps of money. i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit. how i should enjoy it for i wouldnt be idle but do good and make everyone love me dearly.  wouldnt you have a master for your castle in the air asked laurie slyly.  i said pleasant people you know and meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke so that no one saw her face.  why dont you say youd have a splendid wise good husband and some angelic little children you know your castle wouldnt be perfect without said blunt jo who had no tender fancies yet and rather scorned romance except in books.  youd have nothing but horses inkstands and novels in yours answered meg petulantly.  wouldnt i though id have a stable full of arabian steeds rooms piled high with books and id write out of a magic inkstand so that my works should be as famous as lauries music. i want to do something splendid before i go into my castle something heroic or wonderful that wont be forgotten after im dead. i dont know what but im on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all some day. i think i shall write books and get rich and famous that would suit me so that is my favorite dream.  mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother and help take care of the family said beth contentedly.  dont you wish for anything else asked laurie.  since i had my little piano i am perfectly satisfied. i only wish we may all keep well and be together nothing else.  i have ever so many wishes but the pet one is to be an artist and go to rome and do fine pictures and be the best artist in the whole world was amys modest desire.  were an ambitious set arent we every one of us but beth wants to be rich and famous and gorgeous in every respect. i do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes said laurie chewing grass like a meditative calf.  ive got the key to my castle in the air but whether i can unlock the door remains to be seen observed jo mysteriously.  ive got the key to mine but im not allowed to try it. hang college muttered laurie with an impatient sigh.  heres mine and amy waved her pencil.  i havent got any said meg forlornly.  yes you have said laurie at once.  where  in your face.  nonsense thats of no use.  wait and see if it doesnt bring you something worth having replied the boy laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew.  meg colored behind the brake but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which mr. brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.  if we are all alive ten years hence lets meet and see how many of us have got our wishes or how much nearer we are then than now said jo always ready with a plan.  bless me how old i shall be twentyseven exclaimed meg who felt grown up already having just reached seventeen.  you and i will be twentysix teddy beth twentyfour and amy twentytwo. what a venerable party said jo.  i hope i shall have done something to be proud of by that time but im such a lazy dog im afraid i shall dawdle jo.  you need a motive mother says and when you get it she is sure youll work splendidly.  is she by jupiter i will if i only get the chance cried laurie sitting up with sudden energy. i ought to be satisfied to please grandfather and i do try but its working against the grain you see and comes hard. he wants me to be an india merchant as he was and id rather be shot. i hate tea and silk and spices and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring and i dont care how soon they go to the bottom when i own them. going to college ought to satisfy him for if i give him four years he ought to let me off from the business. but hes set and ive got to do just as he did unless i break away and please myself as my father did. if there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman id do it tomorrow.  laurie spoke excitedly and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation for he was growing up very fast and in spite of his indolent ways had a young mans hatred of subjection a young mans restless longing to try the world for himself.  i advise you to sail away in one of your ships and never come home again till you have tried your own way said jo whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit and whose sympathy was excited by what she called teddys wrongs.  thats not right jo. you mustnt talk in that way and laurie mustnt take your bad advice. you should do just what your grandfather wishes my dear boy said meg in her most maternal tone. do your best at college and when he sees that you try to please him im sure he wont be hard on you or unjust to you. as you say there is no one else to stay with and love him and youd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. dont be dismal or fret but do your duty and youll get your reward as good mr. brooke has by being respected and loved.  what do you know about him asked laurie grateful for the good advice but objecting to the lecture and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.  only what your grandpa told us about him how he took good care of his own mother till she died and wouldnt go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldnt leave her. and how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother and never tells anyone but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.  so he is dear old fellow said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story. its like grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know and to tell all his goodness to others so that they might like him. brooke couldnt understand why your mother was so kind to him asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style. if ever i do get my wish you see what ill do for brooke.  begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out said meg sharply.  how do you know i do miss  i can always tell by his face when he goes away. if you have been good he looks satisfied and walks briskly. if you have plagued him hes sober and walks slowly as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.  well i like that so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in brookes face do you i see him bow and smile as he passes your window but i didnt know youd got up a telegraph.  we havent. dont be angry and oh dont tell him i said anything it was only to show that i cared how you get on and what is said here is said in confidence you know cried meg much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech.  i dont tell tales replied laurie with his high and mighty air as jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. only if brooke is going to be a thermometer i must mind and have fair weather for him to report.  please dont be offended. i didnt mean to preach or tell tales or be silly. i only thought jo was encouraging you in a feeling which youd be sorry for byandby. you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. forgive me i meant it kindly. and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.  ashamed of his momentary pique laurie squeezed the kind little hand and said frankly im the one to be forgiven. im cross and have been out of sorts all day. i like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly so dont mind if i am grumpy sometimes. i thank you all the same.  bent on showing that he was not offended he made himself as agreeable as possible wound cotton for meg recited poetry to please jo shook down cones for beth and helped amy with her ferns proving himself a fit person to belong to the busy bee society. in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea to draw and they would just have time to get home to supper.  may i come again asked laurie.  yes if you are good and love your book as the boys in the primer are told to do said meg smiling.  ill try.  then you may come and ill teach you to knit as the scotchmen do. theres a demand for socks just now added jo waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.  that night when beth played to mr. laurence in the twilight laurie standing in the shadow of the curtain listened to the little david whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit and watched the old man who sat with his gray head on his hand thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much. remembering the conversation of the afternoon the boy said to himself with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully ill let my castle go and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me for i am all he has.     chapter fourteen secrets   jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short. for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers. quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming...  there ive done my best if this wont suit i shall have to wait till i can do better.  lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons. then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. jos desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. in it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves. from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.  she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road. once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious.  if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street. having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a blackeyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out.  there was a dentists sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver its like her to come alone but if she has a bad time shell need someone to help her home.  in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod. but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time  not very.  you got through quickly.  yes thank goodness  why did you go alone  didnt want anyone to know.  youre the oddest fellow i ever saw. how many did you have out  jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.  there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week.  what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified.  so are you. what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon  begging your pardon maam it wasnt a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing.  im glad of that.  why  you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and well make a fine thing of the fencing scene.  laurie burst out with a hearty boys laugh which made several passersby smile in spite of themselves.  ill teach you whether we play hamlet or not. its grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. but i dont believe that was your only reason for saying im glad in that decided way was it now  no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places. do you  not often.  i wish you wouldnt.  its no harm jo. i have billiards at home but its no fun unless you have good players so as im fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows.  oh dear im so sorry for youll get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys. i did hope youd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head.  cant a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled.  that depends upon how and where he takes it. i dont like ned and his set and wish youd keep out of it. mother wont let us have him at our house though he wants to come. and if you grow like him she wont be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.  wont she asked laurie anxiously.  no she cant bear fashionable young men and shed shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.  well she neednt get out her bandboxes yet. im not a fashionable party and dont mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then dont you  yes nobody minds them so lark away but dont get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times.  ill be a double distilled saint.  i cant bear saints. just be a simple honest respectable boy and well never desert you. i dont know what i should do if you acted like mr. kings son. he had plenty of money but didnt know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his fathers name i believe and was altogether horrid.  you think im likely to do the same much obliged.  no i dontoh dear nobut i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor. i shouldnt worry then.  do you worry about me jo  a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for youve got such a strong will if you once get started wrong im afraid it would be hard to stop you.  laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings.  are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently.  of course not. why  because if you are ill take a bus. if youre not id like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting.  i wont preach any more and id like to hear the news immensely.  very well then come on. its a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours.  i havent got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had.  you know you haveyou cant hide anything so up and fess or i wont tell cried laurie.  is your secret a nice one  oh isnt it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and ive been aching to tell it this long time. come you begin.  youll not say anything about it at home will you  not a word.  and you wont tease me in private  i never tease.  yes you do. you get everything you want out of people. i dont know how you do it but you are a born wheedler.  thank you. fire away.  well ive left two stories with a newspaperman and hes to give his answer next week whispered jo in her confidants ear.  hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now.  hush it wont come to anything i dare say but i couldnt rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i didnt want anyone else to be disappointed.  it wont fail. why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. wont it be fun to see them in print and shant we feel proud of our authoress  jos eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a friends praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.  wheres your secret play fair teddy or ill never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement.  i may get into a scrape for telling but i didnt promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till ive told you any plummy bit of news i get. i know where megs glove is.  is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.  its quite enough for the present as youll agree when i tell you where it is.  tell then.  laurie bent and whispered three words in jos ear which produced a comical change. she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know  saw it.  where  pocket.  all this time  yes isnt that romantic  no its horrid.  dont you like it  of course i dont. its ridiculous it wont be allowed. my patience what would meg say  you are not to tell anyone. mind that.  i didnt promise.  that was understood and i trusted you.  well i wont for the present anyway but im disgusted and wish you hadnt told me.  i thought youd be pleased.  at the idea of anybody coming to take meg away no thank you.  youll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.  id like to see anyone try it cried jo fiercely.  so should i and laurie chuckled at the idea.  i dont think secrets agree with me i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said jo rather ungratefully.  race down this hill with me and youll be all right suggested laurie.  no one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his atlanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.  i wish i was a horse then i could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath. it was capital but see what a guy its made me. go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said jo dropping down under a maple tree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.  laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. but someone did pass and who should it be but meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls.  what in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her disheveled sister with wellbred surprise.  getting leaves meekly answered jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up.  and hairpins added laurie throwing half a dozen into jos lap. they grow on this road meg so do combs and brown straw hats.  you have been running jo. how could you when will you stop such romping ways said meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties.  never till im stiff and old and have to use a crutch. dont try to make me grow up before my time meg. its hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. let me be a little girl as long as i can.  as she spoke jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that margaret was fast getting to be a woman and lauries secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near. he saw the trouble in her face and drew megs attention from it by asking quickly where have you been calling all so fine  at the gardiners and sallie has been telling me all about belle moffats wedding. it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris. just think how delightful that must be  do you envy her meg said laurie.  im afraid i do.  im glad of it muttered jo tying on her hat with a jerk.  why asked meg looking surprised.  because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said jo frowning at laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said.  i shall never go and marry anyone observed meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on.  for a week or two jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered. she rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to mr. brooke whenever they met would sit looking at meg with a woebegone face occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner. laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about spread eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits. on the second saturday after jo got out of the window meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in amys bower. what went on there meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers.  what shall we do with that girl she never will behave like a young lady sighed meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face.  i hope she wont. she is so funny and dear as she is said beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at jos having secrets with anyone but her.  its very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming way two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.  in a few minutes jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read.  have you anything interesting there asked meg with condescension.  nothing but a story wont amount to much i guess returned jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.  youd better read it aloud. that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said amy in her most grownup tone.  whats the name asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet.  the rival painters.  that sounds well. read it said meg.  with a loud hem and a long breath jo began to read very fast. the girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end. i like that about the splendid picture was amys approving remark as jo paused.  i prefer the lovering part. viola and angelo are two of our favorite names isnt that queer said meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical.  who wrote it asked beth who had caught a glimpse of jos face.  the reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice your sister.  you cried meg dropping her work.  its very good said amy critically.  i knew it i knew it oh my jo i am so proud and beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.  dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg wouldnt believe it till she saw the words. miss josephine march actually printed in the paper. how graciously amy criticized the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately couldnt be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead. how beth got excited and skipped and sang with joy. how hannah came in to exclaim sakes alive well i never in great astonishment at that jos doins. how proud mrs. march was when she knew it. how jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how the spread eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the house of march as the paper passed from hand to hand.  tell us about it. when did it come how much did you get for it what will father say wont laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about jo for these foolish affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.  stop jabbering girls and ill tell you everything said jo wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evelina than she did over her rival painters. having told how she disposed of her tales jo added and when i went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but didnt pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories. it was good practice he said and when the beginners improved anyone would pay. so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him. and he said it was good and i shall write more and hes going to get the next paid for and i am so happy for in time i may be able to support myself and help the girls.  jos breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.     chapter fifteen a telegram   november is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden.  thats the reason i was born in it observed jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.  if something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said beth who took a hopeful view of everything even november.  i dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said meg who was out of sorts. we go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun. we might as well be in a treadmill.  my patience how blue we are cried jo. i dont much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out. oh dont i wish i could manage things for you as i do for my heroines youre pretty enough and good enough already so id have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly. then youd dash out as an heiress scorn everyone who has slighted you go abroad and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.  people dont have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women marry for money. its a dreadfully unjust world said meg bitterly.  jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all. just wait ten years and see if we dont said amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces.  cant wait and im afraid i havent much faith in ink and dirt though im grateful for your good intentions.  meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again. jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but amy spatted away energetically and beth who sat at the other window said smiling two pleasant things are going to happen right away. marmee is coming down the street and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell.  in they both came mrs. march with her usual question any letter from father girls and laurie to say in his persuasive way wont some of you come for a drive ive been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and im going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. its a dull day but the air isnt bad and im going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it isnt out. come jo you and beth will go wont you  of course we will.  much obliged but im busy. and meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive too often with the young gentleman.  we three will be ready in a minute cried amy running away to wash her hands.  can i do anything for you madam mother asked laurie leaning over mrs. marchs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.  no thank you except call at the office if youll be so kind dear. its our day for a letter and the postman hasnt been. father is as regular as the sun but theres some delay on the way perhaps.  a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter.  its one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.  at the word telegraph mrs. march snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. laurie dashed downstairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice...  mrs. march your husband is very ill. come at once. s. hale blank hospital washington.   how still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.  mrs. march was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot i shall go at once but it may be too late. oh children children help me to bear it  for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. poor hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was panacea for most afflictions.  the lord keep the dear man i wont waste no time acryin but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one.  shes right theres no time for tears now. be calm girls and let me think.  they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them.  wheres laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.  here maam. oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.  send a telegram saying i will come at once. the next train goes early in the morning. ill take that.  what else the horses are ready. i can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.  leave a note at aunt marchs. jo give me that pen and paper.  tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father.  now go dear but dont kill yourself driving at a desperate pace. there is no need of that.  mrs. marchs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life.  jo run to the rooms and tell mrs. king that i cant come. on the way get these things. ill put them down theyll be needed and i must go prepared for nursing. hospital stores are not always good. beth go and ask mr. laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. im not too proud to beg for father. he shall have the best of everything. amy tell hannah to get down the black trunk and meg come and help me find my things for im half bewildered.  writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work. everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.  mr. laurence came hurrying back with beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mothers absence which comforted her very much. there was nothing he didnt offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. but the last was impossible. mrs. march would not hear of the old gentlemans undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. he saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying hed be back directly. no one had time to think of him again till as meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon mr. brooke.  im very sorry to hear of this miss march he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. i came to offer myself as escort to your mother. mr. laurence has commissions for me in washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.  down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that mr. brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.  how kind you all are mother will accept im sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. thank you very very much  meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother.  everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said before that she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice the next time. mrs. march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there.  the short afternoon wore away. all other errands were done and meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while beth and amy got tea and hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still jo did not come. they began to get anxious and laurie went off to find her for no one knew what freak jo might take into her head. he missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice thats my contribution toward making father comfortable and bringing him home  my dear where did you get it twentyfive dollars jo i hope you havent done anything rash  no its mine honestly. i didnt beg borrow or steal it. i earned it and i dont think youll blame me for i only sold what was my own.  as she spoke jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short.  your hair your beautiful hair oh jo how could you your one beauty. my dear girl there was no need of this. she doesnt look like my jo any more but i love her dearly for it  as everyone exclaimed and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive anyone a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it it doesnt affect the fate of the nation so dont wail beth. it will be good for my vanity i was getting too proud of my wig. it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. my head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said i could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order. im satisfied so please take the money and lets have supper.  tell me all about it jo. i am not quite satisfied but i cant blame you for i know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love. but my dear it was not necessary and im afraid you will regret it one of these days said mrs. march.  no i wont returned jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.  what made you do it asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.  well i was wild to do something for father replied jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. i hate to borrow as much as mother does and i knew aunt march would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence. meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it.  you neednt feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs. march with a look that warmed jos heart.  i hadnt the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if id like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. in a barbers window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars. it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine.  i dont see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe.  oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. he rather stared at first as if he wasnt used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. he said he didnt care about mine it wasnt the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place. the work put into it made it dear and so on. it was getting late and i was afraid if it wasnt done right away that i shouldnt have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up. so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry. it was silly i dare say but it changed his mind for i got rather excited and told the story in my topsyturvy way and his wife heard and said so kindly take it thomas and oblige the young lady. id do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling.  who was jimmy asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along.  her son she said who was in the army. how friendly such things make strangers feel dont they she talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely.  didnt you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked meg with a shiver.  i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it. i never snivel over trifles like that. i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head. it almost seemed as if id an arm or leg off. the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep. ill give it to you marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable i dont think i shall ever have a mane again.  mrs. march folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. she only said thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about mr. brookes kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed.  no one wanted to go to bed when at ten oclock mrs. march put by the last finished job and said come girls. beth went to the piano and played the fathers favorite hymn. all began bravely but broke down one by one till beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler.  go to bed and dont talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get. good night my darlings said mrs. march as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another.  they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek...  jo dear what is it are you crying about father  no not now.  what then  my... my hair burst out poor jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow.  it did not seem at all comical to meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.  im not sorry protested jo with a choke. id do it again tomorrow if i could. its only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. dont tell anyone its all over now. i thought you were asleep so i just made a little private moan for my one beauty. how came you to be awake  i cant sleep im so anxious said meg.  think about something pleasant and youll soon drop off.  i tried it but felt wider awake than ever.  what did you think of  handsome faceseyes particularly answered meg smiling to herself in the dark.  what color do you like best  brown that is sometimes. blue are lovely.  jo laughed and meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air.  the clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlet here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. as she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence be comforted dear soul there is always light behind the clouds.     chapter sixteen letters   in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within. breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even hannahs familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. the big trunk stood ready in the hall mothers cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. megs eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once and the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them.  nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs. march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag...  children i leave you to hannahs care and mr. laurences protection. hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. dont grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace. hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless.  yes mother.  meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr. laurence. be patient jo dont get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all. beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home.  we will mother we will  the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well. no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.  laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr. brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr. greatheart on the spot.  goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs. march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage.  as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr. laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie.  how kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young mans face.  i dont see how they can help it returned mr. brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs. march could not help smiling. and so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words.  i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.  it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly.  beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on mothers table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly.  hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot.  now my dear young ladies remember what your ma said and dont fret. come and have a cup of coffee all round and then lets fall to work and be a credit to the family.  coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again.  hope and keep busy thats the motto for us so lets see who will remember it best. i shall go to aunt march as usual. oh wont she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit.  i shall go to my kings though id much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she hadnt made her eyes so red.  no need of that. beth and i can keep house perfectly well put in amy with an important air.  hannah will tell us what to do and well have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay.  i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively.  the girls couldnt help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.  the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mothers face. it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.  thats so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face. goodbye meggy i hope the kings wont strain today. dont fret about father dear she added as they parted.  and i hope aunt march wont croak. your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall sisters shoulders.  thats my only comfort. and touching her hat a la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.  news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. mr. brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed. at first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence. as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them.  my dearest mother   it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we couldnt help laughing and crying over it. how very kind mr. brooke is and how fortunate that mr. laurences business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father. the girls are all as good as gold. jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. i should be afraid she might overdo if i didnt know her moral fit wouldnt last long. beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her. she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her. she does her own hair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. mr. laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly. he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away. hannah is a perfect saint. she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect. we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back. give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own...   meg   this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curlytailed letters.  my precious marmee   three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better. i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say im glad im glad didnt that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart. we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good its like living in a nest of turtledoves. youd laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish. she gets prettier every day and im in love with her sometimes. the children are regular archangels and iwell im jo and never shall be anything else. oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie. i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended. i was right but didnt speak as i ought and he marched home saying he wouldnt come again till i begged pardon. i declared i wouldnt and got mad. it lasted all day. i felt bad and wanted you very much. laurie and i are both so proud its hard to beg pardon. but i thought hed come to it for i was in the right. he didnt come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river. i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry. i met him at the gate coming for the same thing. we both laughed begged each others pardon and felt all good and comfortable again.   i made a pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him. give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your...   topsyturvy jo   a song from the suds   queen of my tub i merrily sing while the white foam rises high and sturdily wash and rinse and wring and fasten the clothes to dry. then out in the free fresh air they swing under the sunny sky.   i wish we could wash from our hearts and souls the stains of the week away and let water and air by their magic make ourselves as pure as they. then on the earth there would be indeed a glorious washing day   along the path of a useful life will heartsease ever bloom. the busy mind has no time to think of sorrow or care or gloom. and anxious thoughts may be swept away as we bravely wield a broom.   i am glad a task to me is given to labor at day by day for it brings me health and strength and hope and i cheerfully learn to say head you may think heart you may feel but hand you shall work alway   dear mother   there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see. i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with fathers tune. i cant sing land of the leal now it makes me cry. everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you. amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop. i didnt forget to cover the holders and i wind the clock and air the rooms every day.   kiss dear father on the cheek he calls mine. oh do come soon to your loving...   little beth   ma chere mamma   we are all well i do my lessons always and never corroberate the girlsmeg says i mean contradick so i put in both words and you can take the properest. meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. laurie is not as respeckful as he ought to be now i am almost in my teens he calls me chick and hurts my feelings by talking french to me very fast when i say merci or bon jour as hattie king does. the sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out and meg put in new ones but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. i felt bad but did not fret i bear my troubles well but i do wish hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. cant she didnt i make that interrigation point nice meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and i am mortyfied but dear me i have so many things to do i cant stop. adieu i send heaps of love to papa. your affectionate daughter...   amy curtis march   dear mis march   i jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. the girls is clever and fly round right smart. miss meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper. she hes the liking for it and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. jo doos beat all for goin ahead but she dont stop to calklate fust and you never know where shes like to bring up. she done out a tub of clothes on monday but she starched em afore they was wrenched and blued a pink calico dress till i thought i should a died a laughin. beth is the best of little creeters and a sight of help to me bein so forehanded and dependable. she tries to learn everything and really goes to market beyond her years likewise keeps accounts with my help quite wonderful. we have got on very economical so fur. i dont let the girls hev coffee only once a week accordin to your wish and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. amy does well without frettin wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. mr. laurie is as full of didoes as usual and turns the house upside down frequent but he heartens the girls so i let em hev full swing. the old gentleman sends heaps of things and is rather wearin but means wal and it aint my place to say nothin. my bread is riz so no more at this time. i send my duty to mr. march and hope hes seen the last of his pewmonia.   yours

old house would have supplied the neighborhood. it was really amazing for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and selfdenial was all the fashion. relieved of their first anxiety about their father the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into old ways. they did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many.  jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for aunt march didnt like to hear people read with colds in their heads. jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies. meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the washington dispatches over and over. beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.  all the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone avisiting. when her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears for father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but everyone felt how sweet and helpful beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.  all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise. so they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.  meg i wish youd go and see the hummels. you know mother told us not to forget them. said beth ten days after mrs. marchs departure.  im too tired to go this afternoon replied meg rocking comfortably as she sewed.  cant you jo asked beth.  too stormy for me with my cold.  i thought it was almost well.  its well enough for me to go out with laurie but not well enough to go to the hummels said jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency.  why dont you go yourself asked meg.  i have been every day but the baby is sick and i dont know what to do for it. mrs. hummel goes away to work and lottchen takes care of it. but it gets sicker and sicker and i think you or hannah ought to go.  beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow.  ask hannah for some nice little mess and take it round beth the air will do you good said jo adding apologetically id go but i want to finish my writing.  my head aches and im tired so i thought maybe some of you would go said beth.  amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested meg.  so beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the hummels were forgotten. an hour passed. amy did not come meg went to her room to try on a new dress jo was absorbed in her story and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mothers room. half an hour after jo went to mothers closet for something and there found little beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.  christopher columbus whats the matter cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly. . .  youve had the scarlet fever havent you  years ago when meg did. why  then ill tell you. oh jo the babys dead  what baby  mrs. hummels. it died in my lap before she got home cried beth with a sob.  my poor dear how dreadful for you i ought to have gone said jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mothers big chair with a remorseful face.  it wasnt dreadful jo only so sad i saw in a minute it was sicker but lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so i took baby and let lotty rest. it seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still. i tried to warm its feet and lotty gave it some milk but it didnt stir and i knew it was dead.  dont cry dear what did you do  i just sat and held it softly till mrs. hummel came with the doctor. he said it was dead and looked at heinrich and minna who have sore throats. scarlet fever maam. ought to have called me before he said crossly. mrs. hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. he smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and i cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or id have the fever.  no you wont cried jo hugging her close with a frightened look. oh beth if you should be sick i never could forgive myself what shall we do  dont be frightened i guess i shant have it badly. i looked in mothers book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so i did take some belladonna and i feel better said beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well.  if mother was only at home exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off. she read a page looked at beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely youve been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so im afraid you are going to have it beth. ill call hannah she knows all about sickness.  dont let amy come. she never had it and i should hate to give it to her. cant you and meg have it over again asked beth anxiously.  i guess not. dont care if i do. serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered jo as she went to consult hannah.  the good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody died all of which jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg.  now ill tell you what well do said hannah when she had examined and questioned beth we will have dr. bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right. then well send amy off to aunt marchs for a spell to keep her out of harms way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse beth for a day or two.  i shall stay of course im oldest began meg looking anxious and selfreproachful.  i shall because its my fault she is sick. i told mother id do the errands and i havent said jo decidedly.  which will you have beth there aint no need of but one aid hannah.  jo please. and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point.  ill go and tell amy said meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and jo did.  amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march. meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain. amy protested that she would not go and meg left her in despair to ask hannah what should be done. before she came back laurie walked into the parlor to find amy sobbing with her head in the sofa cushions. she told her story expecting to be consoled but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought. presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone now be a sensible little woman and do as they say. no dont cry but hear what a jolly plan ive got. you go to aunt marchs and ill come and take you out every day driving or walking and well have capital times. wont that be better than moping here  i dont wish to be sent off as if i was in the way began amy in an injured voice.  bless your heart child its to keep you well. you dont want to be sick do you  no im sure i dont but i dare say i shall be for ive been with beth all the time.  thats the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it. change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly. i advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss.  but its dull at aunt marchs and she is so cross said amy looking rather frightened.  it wont be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how beth is and take you out gallivanting. the old lady likes me and ill be as sweet as possible to her so she wont peck at us whatever we do.  will you take me out in the trotting wagon with puck  on my honor as a gentleman.  and come every single day  see if i dont  and bring me back the minute beth is well  the identical minute.  and go to the theater truly  a dozen theaters if we may.  welli guess i will said amy slowly.  good girl call meg and tell her youll give in said laurie with an approving pat which annoyed amy more than the giving in.  meg and jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and amy feeling very precious and selfsacrificing promised to go if the doctor said beth was going to be ill.  how is the little dear asked laurie for beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.  she is lying down on mothers bed and feels better. the babys death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold. hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered meg.  what a trying world it is said jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. no sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. there doesnt seem to be anything to hold on to when mothers gone so im all at sea.  well dont make a porcupine of yourself it isnt becoming. settle your wig jo and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friends one beauty.  that is what troubles me said meg. i think we ought to tell her if beth is really ill but hannah says we mustnt for mother cant leave father and it will only make them anxious. beth wont be sick long and hannah knows just what to do and mother said we were to mind her so i suppose we must but it doesnt seem quite right to me.  hum well i cant say. suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been.  we will. jo go and get dr. bangs at once commanded meg. we cant decide anything till he has been.  stay where you are jo. im errand boy to this establishment said laurie taking up his cap.  im afraid you are busy began meg.  no ive done my lessons for the day.  do you study in vacation time asked jo.  i follow the good example my neighbors set me was lauries answer as he swung himself out of the room.  i have great hopes for my boy observed jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile.  he does very well for a boy was megs somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her.  dr. bangs came said beth had symptoms of the fever but he thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the hummel story. amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with jo and laurie as escort.  aunt march received them with her usual hospitality.  what do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out...  go away. no boys allowed here.  laurie retired to the window and jo told her story.  no more than i expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. amy can stay and make herself useful if she isnt sick which ive no doubt she will be looks like it now. dont cry child it worries me to hear people sniff.  amy was on the point of crying but laurie slyly pulled the parrots tail which caused polly to utter an astonished croak and call out bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead.  what do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly.  father is much better replied jo trying to keep sober.  oh is he well that wont last long i fancy. march never had any stamina was the cheerful reply.  ha ha never say die take a pinch of snuff goodbye goodbye squalled polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old ladys cap as laurie tweaked him in the rear.  hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird and jo youd better go at once. it isnt proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like...  hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.  i dont think i can bear it but ill try thought amy as she was left alone with aunt march.  get along you fright screamed polly and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff.     chapter eighteen dark days   beth did have the fever and was much sicker than anyone but hannah and the doctor suspected. the girls knew nothing about illness and mr. laurence was not allowed to see her so hannah had everything her own way and busy dr. bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. meg stayed at home lest she should infect the kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of beths illness. she could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind hannah and hannah wouldnt hear of mrs. march bein told and worried just for sech a trifle.  jo devoted herself to beth day and night not a hard task for beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. but there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother. then jo grew frightened meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet. a letter from washington added to their trouble for mr. march had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while.  how dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. then it was that margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buyin love protection peace and health the real blessings of life. then it was that jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of beths nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of beths unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty. and amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr. laurence locked the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. everyone missed beth. the milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor mrs. hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little beth had made.  meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo. she sent loving messages to amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that father might not think she had neglected him. but soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. dr. bangs came twice a day hannah sat up at night meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and jo never stirred from beths side.  the first of december was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death. when dr. bangs came that morning he looked long at beth held the hot hand in both his own for a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low voice to hannah if mrs. march can leave her husband shed better be sent for.  hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and jo standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm. she was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak laurie came in with a letter saying that mr. march was mending again. jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that laurie asked quickly what is it is beth worse  ive sent for mother said jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression.  good for you jo did you do it on your own responsibility asked laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook.  no. the doctor told us to.  oh jo its not so bad as that cried laurie with a startled face.  yes it is. she doesnt know us she doesnt even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. she doesnt look like my beth and theres nobody to help us bear it. mother and father both gone and god seems so far away i cant find him.  as the tears streamed fast down poor jos cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat im here. hold on to me jo dear  she could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.  laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. it was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face.  thank you teddy im better now. i dont feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes.  keep hoping for the best that will help you jo. soon your mother will be here and then everything will be all right.  im so glad father is better. now she wont feel so bad about leaving him. oh me it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.  doesnt meg pull fair asked laurie looking indignant.  oh yes she tries to but she cant love bethy as i do and she wont miss her as i shall. beth is my conscience and i cant give her up. i cant i cant  down went jos face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. it might be unmanly but he couldnt help it and i am glad of it. presently as jos sobs quieted he said hopefully i dont think she will die. shes so good and we all love her so much i dont believe god will take her away yet.  the good and dear people always do die groaned jo but she stopped crying for her friends words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears.  poor girl youre worn out. it isnt like you to be forlorn. stop a bit. ill hearten you up in a jiffy.  laurie went off two stairs at a time and jo laid her wearied head down on beths little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. it must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely i drink health to my beth you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend. how can i ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind.  ill send my bill byandby and tonight ill give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something.  what is it cried jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.  i telegraphed to your mother yesterday and brooke answered shed come at once and shell be here tonight and everything will be all right. arent you glad i did it  laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming beth. jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry oh laurie oh mother i am so glad she did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.  laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind. he patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought jo round at once. holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly oh dont i didnt mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldnt help flying at you. tell me all about it and dont give me wine again it makes me act so.  i dont mind laughed laurie as he settled his tie. why you see i got fidgety and so did grandpa. we thought hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know. shed never forgive us if beth... well if anything happened you know. so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off i pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram. i never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and i did it. your mother will come i know and the late train is in at two a.m. i shall go for her and youve only got to bottle up your rapture and keep beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.  laurie youre an angel how shall i ever thank you  fly at me again. i rather liked it said laurie looking mischievous a thing he had not done for a fortnight.  no thank you. ill do it by proxy when your grandpa comes. dont tease but go home and rest for youll be up half the night. bless you teddy bless you  jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her speech she vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it.  thats the interferingest chap i ever see but i forgive him and do hope mrs. march is coming right away said hannah with an air of relief when jo told the good news.  meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while jo set the sickroom in order and hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected. a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. everything appeared to feel the hopeful change. beths bird began to chirp again and a halfblown rose was discovered on amys bush in the window. the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly mothers coming dear mothers coming every one rejoiced but beth. she lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger. it was a piteous sight the once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty wellkept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. all day she lay so only rousing now and then to mutter water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. all day jo and meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in god and mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by. but night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side of the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer. the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return.  hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the beds foot and fell fast asleep mr. laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than mrs. marchs countenance as she entered. laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.  the girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.  if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly.  if god spares beth ill try to love and serve him all my life answered jo with equal fervor.  i wish i had no heart it aches so sighed meg after a pause.  if life is often as hard as this i dont see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently.  here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. the house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush. weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. an hour went by and nothing happened except lauries quiet departure for the station. another hour still no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at washington haunted the girls.  it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their mothers easy chair with her face hidden. a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo as she thought beth is dead and meg is afraid to tell me.  she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. the fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered goodby my beth. goodby  as if awaked by the stir hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath the fevers turned shes sleepin natral her skins damp and she breathes easy. praise be given oh my goodness me  before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it. he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time. keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her...  what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words. when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep.  if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane.  see said meg coming up with a white halfopened rose i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in beths hand tomorrow if shewent away from us. but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and mothers face.  never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done.  it looks like a fairy world said meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight.  hark cried jo starting to her feet.  yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from hannah and then lauries voice saying in a joyful whisper girls shes come shes come     chapter nineteen amys will   while these things were happening at home amy was having hard times at aunt marchs. she felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. aunt march never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the wellbehaved little girl pleased her very much and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her nephews children though she didnt think it proper to confess it. she really did her best to make amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made. some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with childrens little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. but aunt march had not this gift and she worried amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks. finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. so she took amy by the hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago a process which carried dismay to amys soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.  she had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the oldfashioned spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone. then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was. not a speck escaped aunt marchs eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit. then polly had to be fed the lap dog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair. after these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and didnt she enjoy it  laurie came every day and wheedled aunt march till amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times. after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page. then patchwork or towels appeared and amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime. the evenings were the worst of all for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to bed intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.  if it had not been for laurie and old esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. he pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made mop bark by pecking at him while madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird. then she could not endure the dog a fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day. the cook was badtempered the old coachman was deaf and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.  esther was a frenchwoman who had lived with madame as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her. her real name was estelle but aunt march ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. she took a fancy to mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in france when amy sat with her while she got up madames laces. she also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for aunt march hoarded like a magpie. amys chief delight was an indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique. to examine and arrange these things gave amy great satisfaction especially the jewel cases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day her lovers diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn uncle marchs big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay aunt marchs wedding ring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.  which would mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked esther who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.  i like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and im fond of necklaces they are so becoming. i should choose this if i might replied amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.  i too covet that but not as a necklace. ah no to me it is a rosary and as such i should use it like a good catholic said esther eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.  is it meant to use as you use the string of goodsmelling wooden beads hanging over your glass asked amy.  truly yes to pray with. it would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.  you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. i wish i could.  if mademoiselle was a catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom i served before madame. she had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble.  would it be right for me to do so too asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it.  it would be excellent and charming and i shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it. say nothing to madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear god preserve your sister.  esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good.  i wish i knew where all these pretty things would go when aunt march dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.  to you and your sisters. i know it madame confides in me. i witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered esther smiling.  how nice but i wish shed let us have them now. procrastination is not agreeable observed amy taking a last look at the diamonds.  it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. the first one who is affianced will have the pearls madame has said it and i have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.  do you think so oh ill be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring its ever so much prettier than kitty bryants. i do like aunt march after all. and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.  from that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the shutup rooms. she thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that madame would never know it nor care if she did. it was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and amys beautyloving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. on the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear god to preserve her sister. esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for protestant prayers.  the little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe home nest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children. she missed her mothers help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. but amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy. she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it. in her first effort at being very very good she decided to make her will as aunt march had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided. it cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old ladys jewels.  during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from esther as to certain legal terms and when the goodnatured frenchwoman had signed her name amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie whom she wanted as a second witness. as it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took polly with her for company. in this room there was a wardrobe full of oldfashioned costumes with which esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately curtsies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears. so busy was she on this day that she did not hear lauries ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. she was obliged to walk carefully for she had on highheeled shoes and as laurie told jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with polly sidling and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim aint we fine get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha ha  having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty laurie tapped and was graciously received.  sit down and rest while i put these things away then i want to consult you about a very serious matter said amy when she had shown her splendor and driven polly into a corner. that bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while laurie seated himself astride a chair.  yesterday when aunt was asleep and i was trying to be as still as a mouse polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so i went to let him out and found a big spider there. i poked it out and it ran under the bookcase. polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye come out and take a walk my dear. i couldnt help laughing which made poll swear and aunt woke up and scolded us both.  did the spider accept the old fellows invitation asked laurie yawning.  yes out it came and away ran polly frightened to death and scrambled up on aunts chair calling out catch her catch her catch her as i chased the spider.  thats a lie oh lor cried the parrot pecking at lauries toes.  id wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked allyluyer bless your buttons dear  now im ready said amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket. i want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right. i felt i ought to do it for life is uncertain and i dont want any ill feeling over my tomb.  laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling  my last will and testiment   i amy curtis march being in my sane mind go give and bequeethe all my earthly propertyviz. to witnamely   to my father my best pictures sketches maps and works of art including frames. also my  to do what he likes with.   to my mother all my clothes except the blue apron with pocketsalso my likeness and my medal with much love.   to my dear sister margaret i give my turkquoise ring if i get it also my green box with the doves on it also my piece of real lace for her neck and my sketch of her as a memorial of her little girl.   to jo i leave my breastpin the one mended with sealing wax also my bronze inkstandshe lost the coverand my most precious plaster rabbit because i am sorry i burned up her story.   to beth if she lives after me i give my dolls and the little bureau my fan my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. and i herewith also leave her my regret that i ever made fun of old joanna.   to my friend and neighbor theodore laurence i bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadnt any neck. also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes noter dame is the best.   to our venerable benefactor mr. laurence i leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family especially beth.   i wish my favorite playmate kitty bryant to have the blue silk apron and my goldbead ring with a kiss.   to hannah i give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork i leave hoping she will remember me when it you see.   and now having disposed of my most valuable property i hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. i forgive everyone and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. amen.   to this will and testiment i set my hand and seal on this th day of nov. anni domino .   amy curtis march   witnesses   estelle valnor theodore laurence.   the last name was written in pencil and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.  what put it into your head did anyone tell you about beths giving away her things asked laurie soberly as amy laid a bit of red tape with sealing wax a taper and a standish before him.  she explained and then asked anxiously what about beth  im sorry i spoke but as i did ill tell you. she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake. she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa. she never thought of a will.  laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper. amys face was full of trouble but she only said dont people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes  yes codicils they call them.  put one in mine then that i wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends. i forgot it but i want it done though it will spoil my looks.  laurie added it smiling at amys last and greatest sacrifice. then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials. but when he came to go amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips is there really any danger about beth  im afraid there is but we must hope for the best so dont cry dear. and laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.  when he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.     chapter twenty confidential   i dont think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that megs tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and mothers face. too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.  hannah had dished up an astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of fathers state mr. brookes promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort lauries hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold.  what a strange yet pleasant day that was. so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door. with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like stormbeaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. mrs. march would not leave beths side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure.  laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so. amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in lauries opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman. even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone. she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother. she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.  after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and im not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by amys cry of joy at sight of her mother. there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her mothers lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.  on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the wellworn little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us. there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. i think my little girl is learning this.  yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which ive tried to make. the womans face is not good its too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much. i like to think he was a little child once for then i dont seem so far away and that helps me.  as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his mothers knee mrs. march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a minutes pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it. aunt gave me the ring today. she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and shed like to keep me always. she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as its too big. id like to wear them mother can i  they are very pretty but i think youre rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs. march looking at the plump little hand with the band of skyblue stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.  ill try not to be vain said amy. i dont think i like it only because its so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something.  do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing.  no to remind me not to be selfish. amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan.  ive thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so im going to try hard to cure it if i can. beth isnt selfish and thats the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. people wouldnt feel so bad about me if i was sick and i dont deserve to have them but id like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so im going to try and be like beth all i can. im apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better. may we try this way  yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet. wear your ring dear and do your best. i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. now i must go back to beth. keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again.  that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the travelers safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into beths room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look.  what is it deary asked mrs. march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence.  i want to tell you something mother.  about meg  how quickly you guessed yes its about her and though its a little thing it fidgets me.  beth is asleep. speak low and tell me all about it. that moffat hasnt been here i hope asked mrs. march rather sharply.  no. i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her mothers feet. last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned. we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr. brooke owned that he liked meg but didnt dare say so she was so young and he so poor. now isnt it a dreadful state of things  do you think meg cares for him asked mrs. march with an anxious look.  mercy me i dont know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing fainting away growing thin and acting like fools. now meg does not do anything of the sort. she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers. i forbid him to do it but he doesnt mind me as he ought.  then you fancy that meg is not interested in john  who cried jo staring.  mr. brooke. i call him john now. we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it.  oh dear i know youll take his part. hes been good to father and you wont send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to. mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him. and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.  my dear dont get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened. john went with me at mr. laurences request and was so devoted to poor father that we couldnt help getting fond of him. he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could. he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to megs engaging herself so young.  of course not. it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing. i felt it and now its worse than i imagined. i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family.  this odd arrangement made mrs. march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and dont wish you to say anything to meg yet. when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him.  shell see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her. shes got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her. she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and doesnt think john an ugly name and shell go and fall in love and theres an end of peace and fun and cozy times together. i see it all theyll go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge. meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more. brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable. oh dear me why werent we all boys then there wouldnt be any bother.  jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john. mrs. march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief.  you dont like it mother im glad of it. lets send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been.  i did wrong to sigh jo. it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her. your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty. if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so. she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly. my pretty tender hearted girl i hope things will go happily with her.  hadnt you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her mothers voice faltered a little over the last words.  money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly nor be tempted by too much. i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable. im not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls. if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good mans heart and that is better than a fortune.  i understand mother and quite agree but im disappointed about meg for id planned to have her marry teddy byandby and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. wouldnt it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face.  he is younger than she you know began mrs. march but jo broke in...  only a little hes old for his age and tall and can be quite grownup in his manners if he likes. then hes rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say its a pity my plan is spoiled.  im afraid laurie is hardly grownup enough for meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on. dont make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. we cant meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship.  well i wont but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out. i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up. but buds will be roses and kittens cats mores the pity  whats that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.  only one of my stupid speeches. im going to bed. come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.  quite right and beautifully written. please add that i send my love to john said mrs. march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back.  do you call him john asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her mothers.  yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied mrs. march returning the look with a keen one.  im glad of that he is so lonely. good night mother dear. it is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was megs answer.  the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away mrs. march said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret she does not love john yet but will soon learn to.     chapter twentyone laurie makes mischief and jo makes peace   jos face was a study next day for the secret rather weighed upon her and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. meg observed it but did not trouble herself to make inquiries for she had learned that the best way to manage jo was by the law of contraries so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. she was rather surprised therefore when the silence remained unbroken and jo assumed a patronizing air which decidedly aggravated meg who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. this left jo to her own devices for mrs. march had taken her place as nurse and bade her rest exercise and amuse herself after her long confinement. amy being gone laurie was her only refuge and much as she enjoyed his society she rather dreaded him just then for he was an incorrigible tease and she feared he would coax the secret from her.  she was quite right for the mischiefloving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out and led jo a trying life of it. he wheedled bribed ridiculed threatened and scolded affected indifference that he might surprise the truth from her declared he knew then that he didnt care and at last by dint of perseverance he satisfied himself that it concerned meg and mr. brooke. feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutors confidence he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.  meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her fathers return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself. she started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face. to her mothers inquiries she answered that she was quite well and jos she silenced by begging to be let alone.  she feels it in the airlove i meanand shes going very fast. shes got most of the symptomsis twittery and cross doesnt eat lies awake and mopes in corners. i caught her singing that song he gave her and once she said john as you do and then turned as red as a poppy. whatever shall we do said jo looking ready for any measures however violent.  nothing but wait. let her alone be kind and patient and fathers coming will settle everything replied her mother.  heres a note to you meg all sealed up. how odd teddy never seals mine said jo next day as she distributed the contents of the little post office.  mrs. march and jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.  my child what is it cried her mother running to her while jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.  its all a mistake he didnt send it. oh jo how could you do it and meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart were quite broken.  me ive done nothing whats she talking about cried jo bewildered.  megs mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at jo saying reproachfully you wrote it and that bad boy helped you. how could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both  jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand.  my dearest margaret   i can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before i return. i dare not tell your parents yet but i think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. mr. laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy. i implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through laurie to   your devoted john.   oh the little villain thats the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother. ill give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried jo burning to execute immediate justice. but her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore...  stop jo you must clear yourself first. you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this.  on my word mother i havent i never saw that note before and dont know anything about it as true as i live said jo so earnestly that they believed her. if i had taken part in it id have done it better than this and have written a sensible note. i should think youd have known mr. brooke wouldnt write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper.  its like his writing faltered meg comparing it with the note in her hand.  oh meg you didnt answer it cried mrs. march quickly.  yes i did and meg hid her face again overcome with shame.  heres a scrape do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured. i cant rest till i get hold of him. and jo made for the door again.  hush let me handle this for it is worse than i thought. margaret tell me the whole story commanded mrs. march sitting down by meg yet keeping hold of jo lest she should fly off.  i received the first letter from laurie who didnt look as if he knew anything about it began meg without looking up. i was worried at first and meant to tell you then i remembered how you liked mr. brooke so i thought you wouldnt mind if i kept my little secret for a few days. im so silly that i liked to think no one knew and while i was deciding what to say i felt like the girls in books who have such things to do. forgive me mother im paid for my silliness now. i never can look him in the face again.  what did you say to him asked mrs. march.  i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet that i didnt wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father. i was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while.  mrs. march smiled as if well pleased and jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh you are almost equal to caroline percy who was a pattern of prudence tell on meg. what did he say to that  he writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any love letter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister jo should take liberties with our names. its very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me  meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and jo tramped about the room calling laurie names. all of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly i dont believe brooke ever saw either of these letters. teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because i wouldnt tell him my secret.  dont have any secrets jo. tell it to mother and keep out of trouble as i should have done said meg warningly.  bless you child mother told me.  that will do jo. ill comfort meg while you go and get laurie. i shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once.  away ran jo and mrs. march gently told meg mr. brookes real feelings. now dear what are your own do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present  ive been so scared and worried i dont want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while perhaps never answered meg petulantly. if john doesnt know anything about this nonsense dont tell him and make jo and laurie hold their tongues. i wont be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. its a shame  seeing megs usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke mrs. march soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. the instant lauries step was heard in the hall meg fled into the study and mrs. march received the culprit alone. jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he wouldnt come but he knew the minute he saw mrs. marchs face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.  when they were called in laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact. meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke.  ill never tell him to my dying day wild horses shant drag it out of me so youll forgive me meg and ill do anything to show how outandout sorry i am he added looking very much ashamed of himself.  ill try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do i didnt think you could be so sly and malicious laurie replied meg trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.  it was altogether abominable and i dont deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though wont you and laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.  meg pardoned him and mrs. marchs grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.  jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation. laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word.  as soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for teddy. after resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house.  is mr. laurence in asked jo of a housemaid who was coming downstairs.  yes miss but i dont believe hes seeable just yet.  why not is he ill  la no miss but hes had a scene with mr. laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so i dursnt go nigh him.  where is laurie  shut up in his room and he wont answer though ive been atapping. i dont know whats to become of the dinner for its ready and theres no one to eat it.  ill go and see what the matter is. im not afraid of either of them.  up went jo and knocked smartly on the door of lauries little study.  stop that or ill open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone.  jo immediately knocked again. the door flew open and in she bounced before laurie could recover from his surprise. seeing that he really was out of temper jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly please forgive me for being so cross. i came to make it up and cant go away till i have.  its all right. get up and dont be a goose jo was the cavalier reply to her petition.  thank you i will. could i ask whats the matter you dont look exactly easy in your mind.  ive been shaken and i wont bear it growled laurie indignantly.  who did it demanded jo.  grandfather. if it had been anyone else id have... and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.  thats nothing. i often shake you and you dont mind said jo soothingly.  pooh youre a girl and its fun but ill allow no man to shake me  i dont think anyone would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now. why were you treated so  just because i wouldnt say what your mother wanted me for. id promised not to tell and of course i wasnt going to break my word.  couldnt you satisfy your grandpa in any other way  no he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. id have told my part of the scrape if i could without bringing meg in. as i couldnt i held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. then i bolted for fear i should forget myself.  it wasnt nice but hes sorry i know so go down and make up. ill help you.  hanged if i do im not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone just for a bit of a frolic. i was sorry about meg and begged pardon like a man but i wont do it again when i wasnt in the wrong.  he didnt know that.  he ought to trust me and not act as if i was a baby. its no use jo hes got to learn that im able to take care of myself and dont need anyones apron string to hold on by.  what pepper pots you are sighed jo. how do you mean to settle this affair  well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when i say i cant tell him what the fusss about.  bless you he wont do that.  i wont go down till he does.  now teddy be sensible. let it pass and ill explain what i can. you cant stay here so whats the use of being melodramatic  i dont intend to stay here long anyway. ill slip off and take a journey somewhere and when grandpa misses me hell come round fast enough.  i dare say but you ought not to go and worry him.  dont preach. ill go to washington and see brooke. its gay there and ill enjoy myself after the troubles.  what fun youd have i wish i could run off too said jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.  come on then why not you go and surprise your father and ill stir up old brooke. it would be a glorious joke. lets do it jo. well leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once. ive got money enough. it will do you good and no harm as you go to your father.  for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her. she was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun. her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.  if i was a boy wed run away together and have a capital time but as im a miserable girl i must be proper and stop at home. dont tempt me teddy its a crazy plan.  thats the fun of it began laurie who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.  hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears. prunes and prisms are my doom and i may as well make up my mind to it. i came here to moralize not to hear things that make me skip to think of.  i know meg would wetblanket such a proposal but i thought you had more spirit began laurie insinuatingly.  bad boy be quiet sit down and think of your own sins dont go making me add to mine. if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked jo seriously.  yes but you wont do it answered laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.  if i can manage the young one i can the old one muttered jo as she walked away leaving laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.  come in and mr. laurences gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as jo tapped at his door.  its only me sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered.  want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it.  yes please. i like old sam so well i think ill try the second volume returned jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of boswells johnson as he had recommended that lively work.  the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed. jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. mr. laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.  what has that boy been about dont try to shield him. i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. i cant get a word from him and when i threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.  he did wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to anyone began jo reluctantly.  that wont do. he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. if hes done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished. out with it jo. i wont be kept in the dark.  mr. laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out.  indeed sir i cannot tell. mother forbade it. laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough. we dont keep silence to shield him but someone else and it will make more trouble if you interfere. please dont. it was partly my fault but its all right now. so lets forget it and talk about the rambler or something pleasant.  hang the rambler come down and give me your word that this harumscarum boy of mine hasnt done anything ungrateful or impertinent. if he has after all your kindness to him ill thrash him with my own hands.  the threat sounded awful but did not alarm jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary. she obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying meg or forgetting the truth.  hum... ha... well if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy ill forgive him. hes a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said mr. laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.  so am i but a kind word will govern me when all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt said jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.  you think im not kind to him hey was the sharp answer.  oh dear no sir. you are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. dont you think you are  jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech. to her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly youre right girl i am i love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and i know how it will end if we go on so.  ill tell you hell run away. jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made. she meant to warn him that laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.  mr. laurences ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table. it was lauries father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old mans will. jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue.  he wont do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying. i often think i should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for india.  she laughed as she spoke and mr. laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke.  you hussy how dare you talk in that way wheres your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls what torments they are yet we cant do without them he said pinching her cheeks goodhumoredly. go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him its all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. i wont bear it.  he wont come sir. he feels badly because you didnt believe him when he said he couldnt tell. i think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.  jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for mr. laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won.  im sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me i suppose. what the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.  if i were you id write him an apology sir. he says he wont come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way. a formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable. try it. he likes fun and this way is better than talking. ill carry it up and teach him his duty.  mr. laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly youre a sly puss but i dont mind being managed by you and beth. here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense.  the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. jo dropped a kiss on the top of mr. laurences bald head and ran up to slip the apology under lauries door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities. finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance what a good fellow you are jo did you get blown up he added laughing.  no he was pretty mild on the whole.  ah i got it all round. even you cast me off over there and i felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically.  dont talk that way turn over a new leaf and begin again teddy my son.  i keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as i used to spoil my copybooks and i make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully.  go and eat your dinner youll feel better after it. men always croak when they are hungry and jo whisked out at the front door after that.  thats a label on my sect answered laurie quoting amy as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.  everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered. she never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once jo rummaging her sisters desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words mrs. john brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that lauries prank had hastened the evil day for her.     chapter twentytwo pleasant meadows   like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. the invalids improved rapidly and mr. march began to talk of returning early in the new year. beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the wellbeloved cats at first and in time with dolls sewing which had fallen sadly behindhand. her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.  as christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry christmas. laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way. after many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.  several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day. hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. to begin with mr. march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her mothers gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie. the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.  the jungfrau to beth   god bless you dear queen bess may nothing you dismay but health and peace and happiness be yours this christmas day.   heres fruit to feed our busy bee and flowers for her nose. heres music for her pianee an afghan for her toes   a portrait of joanna see by raphael no.  who laboured with great industry to make it fair and true.   accept a ribbon red i beg for madam purrers tail and ice cream made by lovely peg a mont blanc in a pail.   their dearest love my makers laid within my breast of snow. accept it and the alpine maid from laurie and from jo.   how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them.  im so full of happiness that if father was only here i couldnt hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her.  so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the longdesired undine and sintram.  im sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.  of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress for mr. laurence had insisted on giving it. how can i be otherwise said mrs. march gratefully as her eyes went from her husbands letter to beths smiling face and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast.  now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is. half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came. laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice heres another christmas present for the march family.  before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and couldnt. of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word.  mr. march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms. jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the china closet. mr. brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained. and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her fathers boots in the most touching manner. mrs. march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth.  but it was too late. the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and beth ran straight into her fathers arms. never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.  it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen. as the laugh subsided mrs. march began to thank mr. brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr. brooke suddenly remembered that mr. march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired. then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.  mr. march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man. why mr. march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine. also why mrs. march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he wouldnt like to have something to eat. jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes  there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day. the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated. so was the plum pudding which melted in ones mouth likewise the jellies in which amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that its a merrycle i didnt roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth.  mr. laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr. brooke at whom jo glowered darkly to lauries infinite amusement. two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. they drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time. a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire.  just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have. do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.  rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr. brooke with dignity.  i think its been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.  im glad its over because weve got you back whispered beth who sat on her fathers knee.  rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it. but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr. march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him.  how do you know did mother tell you asked jo.  not much. straws show which way the wind blows and ive made several discoveries today.  oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him.  here is one. and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm. i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so. it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes i read a little history. a burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and im sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches. meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments. im proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away.  if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her fathers hand and the approving smile he gave her.  what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her fathers ear.  he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with an unusually mild expression in her face.  in spite of the curly crop i dont see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr. march. i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do. her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower. she doesnt bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied. i dont know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i couldnt find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the fiveandtwenty dollars my good girl sent me.  jos keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her fathers praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.  now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait.  theres so little of her im afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully. but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own ive got you safe my beth and ill keep you so please god.  after a minutes silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair...  i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.  what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring.  i read in pilgrims progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their journeys end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her fathers arms and went to the instrument its singing time now and i want to be in my old place. ill try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the pilgrims heard. i made the music for father because he likes the verses.  so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her.  he that is down need fear no fall he that is low no pride. he that is humble ever shall have god to be his guide.   i am content with what i have little be it or much. and lord contentment still i crave because thou savest such.   fulness to them a burden is that go on pilgrimage. here little and hereafter bliss is best from age to age     chapter twentythree aunt march settles the question   like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about mr. march the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. as he sat propped up in a big chair by beths sofa with the other three close by and hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact. mr. and mrs. march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg. jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at mr. brookes umbrella which had been left in the hall. meg was absentminded shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when johns name was mentioned. amy said everyone seemed waiting for something and couldnt settle down which was queer since father was safe at home and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didnt run over as usual.  laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down on one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon. and when meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.  what does the goose mean said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious.  hes showing you how your john will go on byandby. touching isnt it answered jo scornfully.  dont say my john it isnt proper or true but megs voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. please dont plague me jo ive told you i dont care much about him and there isnt to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before.  we cant for something has been said and lauries mischief has spoiled you for me. i see it and so does mother. you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me. i dont mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but i do wish it was all settled. i hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said jo pettishly.  i cant say anything till he speaks and he wont because father said i was too young began meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point.  if he did speak you wouldnt know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no.  im not so silly and weak as you think. i know just what i should say for ive planned it all so i neednt be taken unawares. theres no knowing what may happen and i wished to be prepared.  jo couldnt help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks.  would you mind telling me what youd say asked jo more respectfully.  not at all. you are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidant and my experience will be useful to you byandby perhaps in your own affairs of this sort.  dont mean to have any. its fun to watch other people philander but i should feel like a fool doing it myself said jo looking alarmed at the thought.  i think not if you liked anyone very much and he liked you. meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.  i thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said jo rudely shortening her sisters little reverie.  oh i should merely say quite calmly and decidedly thank you mr. brooke you are very kind but i agree with father that i am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were.  hum thats stiff and cool enough i dont believe youll ever say it and i know he wont be satisfied if you do. if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books youll give in rather than hurt his feelings.  no i wont. i shall tell him ive made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity.  meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time. jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.  good afternoon. i came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said mr. brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.  its very well hes in the rack. ill get him and tell it you are here. and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring...  mother will like to see you. pray sit down ill call her.  dont go. are you afraid of me margaret and mr. brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude. she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully...  how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it.  shall i tell you how asked mr. brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.  oh no please dont id rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial.  i wont trouble you. i only want to know if you care for me a little meg. i love you so much dear added mr. brooke tenderly.  this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg didnt make it. she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i dont know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.  he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i cant go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not.  im too young faltered meg wondering why she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it.  ill wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me. would it be a very hard lesson dear  not if i chose to learn it but. . .  please choose to learn meg. i love to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.  his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. this nettled her. annie moffats foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i dont choose. please go away and let me be  poor mr. brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him.  do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away.  yes i do. i dont want to be worried about such things. father says i neednt its too soon and id rather not.  maynt i hope youll change your mind byandby ill wait and say nothing till you have had more time. dont play with me meg. i didnt think that of you.  dont think of me at all. id rather you wouldnt said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lovers patience and her own power.  he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did. he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself. what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.  the old lady couldnt resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr. marchs arrival drove straight out to see him. the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them. she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr. brooke vanished into the study.  bless me whats all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.  its fathers friend. im so surprised to see you stammered meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now.  thats evident returned aunt march sitting down. but what is fathers friend saying to make you look like a peony theres mischief going on and i insist upon knowing what it is with another rap.  we were only talking. mr. brooke came for his umbrella began meg wishing that mr. brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.  brooke that boys tutor ah i understand now. i know all about it. jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your fathers letters and i made her tell me. you havent gone and accepted him child cried aunt march looking scandalized.  hush hell hear. shant i call mother said meg much troubled.  not yet. ive something to say to you and i must free my mind at once. tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you. remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively.  now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it. the best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love. if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke she would probably have declared she couldnt think of it but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would. inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.  i shall marry whom i please aunt march and you can leave your money to anyone you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air.  hightytighty is that the way you take my advice miss youll be sorry for it byandby when youve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure.  it cant be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted meg.  aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood. meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independent so glad to defend john and assert her right to love him if she liked. aunt march saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could now meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice. i mean it kindly and dont want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. you ought to marry well and help your family. its your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.  father and mother dont think so. they like john though he is poor.  your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies.  im glad of it cried meg stoutly.  aunt march took no notice but went on with her lecture. this rook is poor and hasnt got any rich relations has he  no but he has many warm friends.  you cant live on friends try it and see how cool theyll grow. he hasnt any business has he  not yet. mr. laurence is going to help him.  that wont last long. james laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on. so you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better i thought you had more sense meg.  i couldnt do better if i waited half my life john is good and wise hes got heaps of talent hes willing to work and sure to get on hes so energetic and brave. everyone likes and respects him and im proud to think he cares for me though im so poor and young and silly said meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.  he knows you have got rich relations child. thats the secret of his liking i suspect.  aunt march how dare you say such a thing john is above such meanness and i wont listen to you a minute if you talk so cried meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old ladys suspicions. my john wouldnt marry for money any more than i would. we are willing to work and we mean to wait. im not afraid of being poor for ive been happy so far and i know i shall be with him because he loves me and i...  meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she hadnt made up her mind that she had told her john to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.  aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the girls happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.  well i wash my hands of the whole affair you are a willful child and youve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. no i wont stop. im disappointed in you and havent spirits to see your father now. dont expect anything from me when you are married. your mr. brookes friends must take care of you. im done with you forever.  and slamming the door in megs face aunt march drove off in high dudgeon. she seemed to take all the girls courage with her for when left alone meg stood for a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry. before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by mr. brooke who said all in one breath i couldnt help hearing meg. thank you for defending me and aunt march for proving that you do care for me a little bit.  i didnt know how much till she abused you began meg.  and i neednt go away but may stay and be happy may i dear  here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in jos eyes by meekly whispering yes john and hiding her face on mr. brookes waistcoat.  fifteen minutes after aunt marchs departure jo came softly downstairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself she has seen him away as we planned and that affair is settled. ill go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it.  but poor jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strongminded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer sister jo congratulate us  that was adding insult to injury it was altogether too much and making some wild demonstration with her hands jo vanished without a word. rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room oh do somebody go down quick john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it  mr. and mrs. march left the room with speed and casting herself upon the bed jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to beth and amy. the little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats.  nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet mr. brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.  the tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that jo hadnt the heart to be jealous or dismal. amy was very much impressed by johns devotion and megs dignity beth beamed at them from a distance while mr. and mrs. march surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident aunt march was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies. no one ate much but everyone looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there.  you cant say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you meg said amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make.  no im sure i cant. how much has happened since i said that it seems a year ago answered meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.  the joys come close upon the sorrows this time and i rather think the changes have begun said mrs. march. in most families there comes now and then a year full of events. this has been such a one but it ends well after all.  hope the next will end better muttered jo who found it very hard to see meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way.  i hope the third year from this will end better. i mean it shall if i live to work out my plans said mr. brooke smiling at meg as if everything had become possible to him now.  doesnt it seem very long to wait asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding.  ive got so much to learn before i shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before.  you have only to wait i am to do the work said john beginning his labors by picking up megs napkin with an expression which caused jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged here comes laurie. now we shall have some sensible conversation.  but jo was mistaken for laurie came prancing in overflowing with good spirits bearing a great bridallooking bouquet for mrs. john brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.  i knew brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything its done though the sky falls said laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations.  much obliged for that recommendation. i take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered mr. brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil.  ill come if im at the ends of the earth for the sight of jos face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. you dont look festive maam whats the matter asked laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet mr. laurence.  i dont approve of the match but ive made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said jo solemnly. you cant know how hard it is for me to give up meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice.  you dont give her up. you only go halves said laurie consolingly.  it can never be the same again. ive lost my dearest friend sighed jo.  youve got me anyhow. im not good for much i know but ill stand by you jo all the days of my life. upon my word i will and laurie meant what he said.  i know you will and im ever so much obliged. you are always a great comfort to me teddy returned jo gratefully shaking hands.  well now dont be dismal theres a good fellow. its all right you see. meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house. well have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then well go abroad on some nice trip or other. wouldnt that console you  i rather think it would but theres no knowing what may happen in three years said jo thoughtfully.  thats true. dont you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then i do returned laurie.  i think not for i might see something sad and everyone looks so happy now i dont believe they could be much improved. and jos eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one.  father and mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked. jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.  so the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy. whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called little women.     part    in order that we may start afresh and go to megs wedding...     chapter twentyfour gossip   in order that we may start afresh and go to megs wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the marches. and here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as i fear they may im not afraid the young folks will make that objection i can only say with mrs. march what can you expect when i have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way  the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. the war is over and mr. march safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace a quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely.  these attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. earnest young men found the grayheaded scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel. sinners told their sins to the purehearted old man and were both rebuked and saved. gifted men found a companion in him. ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they wouldnt pay.  to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father.  the girls gave their hearts into their mothers keeping their souls into their fathers and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.  mrs. march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in megs affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly missionarys visits.  john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return. he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg. with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr. laurences more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.  meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier. she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg couldnt help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same. but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot sallies splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom.  jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress. so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely. jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past. not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved everyones friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.  as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently. but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame.  laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself. a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts.  being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies. the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him.  amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at amys shrine. and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote.  that was the name of the little brown house mr. brooke had prepared for megs first home. laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo. it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a weatherbeaten urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted. but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pellmell into the coalbin. but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory. there were no marbletopped tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.  i dont think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than amys artistic hand or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away megs few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis. brooke came home. i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.  people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.  what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over lauries ridiculous bargains. in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever. his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt laborsaving soap that took the skin off ones hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.  in vain meg begged him to stop. john laughed at him and jo called him mr. toodles. he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. so each week beheld some fresh absurdity.  everything was done at last even to amys arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and beths setting the table for the first meal.  are you satisfied does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked mrs. march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.  yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i cant talk about it with a look that was far better than words.  if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.  mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first. there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly.  sallie moffat has four began amy.  if meg had four the house wouldnt hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles.  sallie isnt a poor mans wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment. meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one. its a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip. when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.  why didnt you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg.  i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me. it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help. you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you byandby when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served.  yes mother im sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping. do you know i like this room most of all in my baby house added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her wellstored linen closet.  beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array. all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke. you see having said that if meg married that brooke she shouldnt have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. mrs. carrol florences mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the oldfashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.  thats a housewifely taste which i am glad to see. i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs. march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.  i havent a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days hannah says. and meg looked quite contented as well she might.  a tall broadshouldered young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs. march with both hands out and a hearty...  here i am mother yes its all right.  the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss.  for mrs. john brooke with the makers congratulations and compliments. bless you beth what a refreshing spectacle you are jo. amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.  as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pulled beths hair ribbon stared at jos big pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk.  where is john asked meg anxiously.  stopped to get the license for tomorrow maam.  which side won the last match teddy inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.  ours of course. wish youd been there to see.  how is the lovely miss randal asked amy with a significant smile.  more cruel than ever. dont you see how im pining away and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.  whats the last joke undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.  its a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a watchmans rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls.  any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs. meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy. nice thing isnt it and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.  theres gratitude for you and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction. i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she hadnt defended it manfully id have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one.  i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone.  im doing my best maam but cant get much higher im afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier.  i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spickandspan bower so as im tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently.  mother and i are going to wait for john. there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away.  beth and i are going over to kitty bryants to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.  come jo dont desert a fellow. im in such a state of exhaustion i cant get home without help. dont take off your apron whatever you do its peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps.  now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together. you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans.  not a prank.  and dont say funny things when we ought to be sober.  i never do. you are the one for that.  and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. i shall certainly laugh if you do.  you wont see me youll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect.  i never cry unless for some great affliction.  such as fellows going to college hey cut in laurie with suggestive laugh.  dont be a peacock. i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.  exactly. i say jo how is grandpa this week pretty amiable  very. why have you got into a scrape and want to know how hell take it asked jo rather sharply.  now jo do you think id look your mother in the face and say all right if it wasnt and laurie stopped short with an injured air.  no i dont.  then dont go and be suspicious. i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone.  you spend a great deal teddy.  bless you i dont spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it.  you are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow and cant say no to anyone. we heard about henshaw and all you did for him. if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly.  oh he made a mountain out of a molehill. you wouldnt have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you  of course not but i dont see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home. i thought youd got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot. just now its the fashion to be hideous to make your head look like a scrubbing brush wear a strait jacket orange gloves and clumping squaretoed boots. if it was cheap ugliness id say nothing but it costs as much as the other and i dont get any satisfaction out of it.  laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the felt hat fell off and jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a roughandready costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket.  dont lecture any more theres a good soul i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home. ill get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends.  ill leave you in peace if youll only let your hair grow. im not aristocratic but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter observed jo severely.  this unassuming style promotes study thats why we adopt it returned laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarterinchlong stubble.  by the way jo i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy. he talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner. hed better nip his little passion in the bud hadnt he added laurie in a confidential elder brotherly tone after a minutes silence.  of course he had. we dont want any more marrying in this family for years to come. mercy on us what are the children thinking of and jo looked as much scandalized as if amy and little parker were not yet in their teens.  its a fast age and i dont know what we are coming to maam. you are a mere infant but youll go next jo and well be left lamenting said laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.  dont be alarmed. im not one of the agreeable sort. nobody will want me and its a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family.  you wont give anyone a chance said laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. you wont show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and cant help showing that he likes it you treat him as mrs. gummidge did her sweetheart throw cold water over him and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you.  i dont like that sort of thing. im too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think its dreadful to break up families so. now dont say any more about it. megs wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. i dont wish to get cross so lets change the subject and jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.  whatever his feelings might have been laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate mark my words jo youll go next.     chapter twentyfive the first wedding   the june roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were. quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest fullblown flower to the palest baby bud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.  meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty. neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have. i dont want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom i love and to them i wish to look and be my familiar self.  so she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her john liked best of all the flowers that grew.  you do look just like our own dear meg only so very sweet and lovely that i should hug you if it wouldnt crumple your dress cried amy surveying her with delight when all was done.  then i am satisfied. but please hug and kiss me everyone and dont mind my dress. i want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today and meg opened her arms to her sisters who clung about her with april faces for a minute feeling that the new love had not changed the old.  now im going to tie johns cravat for him and then to stay a few minutes with father quietly in the study and meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies and then to follow her mother wherever she went conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.  as the younger girls stand together giving the last touches to their simple toilet it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance for all are looking their best just now.  jos angles are much softened she has learned to carry herself with ease if not grace. the curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.  beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever. the beautiful kind eyes are larger and in them lies an expression that saddens one although it is not sad itself. it is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience but beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of being better soon.  amy is with truth considered the flower of the family for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a fullgrown woman not beautiful but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. one saw it in the lines of her figure the make and motion of her hands the flow of her dress the droop of her hair unconscious yet harmonious and as attractive to many as beauty itself. amys nose still afflicted her for it never would grow grecian so did her mouth being too wide and having a decided chin. these offending features gave character to her whole face but she never could see it and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion keen blue eyes and curls more golden and abundant than ever.  all three wore suits of thin silver gray their best gowns for the summer with blush roses in hair and bosom and all three looked just what they were freshfaced happyhearted girls pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.  there were to be no ceremonious performances everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible so when aunt march arrived she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.  upon my word heres a state of things cried the old lady taking the seat of honor prepared for her and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle. you oughtnt to be seen till the last minute child.  im not a show aunty and no one is coming to stare at me to criticize my dress or count the cost of my luncheon. im too happy to care what anyone says or thinks and im going to have my little wedding just as i like it. john dear heres your hammer. and away went meg to help that man in his highly improper employment.  mr. brooke didnt even say thank you but as he stooped for the unromantic tool he kissed his little bride behind the folding door with a look that made aunt march whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.  a crash a cry and a laugh from laurie accompanied by the indecorous exclamation jupiter ammon jos upset the cake again caused a momentary flurry which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived and the party came in as beth used to say when a child.  dont let that young giant come near me he worries me worse than mosquitoes whispered the old lady to amy as the rooms filled and lauries black head towered above the rest.  he has promised to be very good today and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes returned amy and gliding away to warn hercules to beware of the dragon which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.  there was no bridal procession but a sudden silence fell upon the room as mr. march and the young couple took their places under the green arch. mother and sisters gathered close as if loath to give meg up. the fatherly voice broke more than once which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. the bridegrooms hand trembled visibly and no one heard his replies. but meg looked straight up in her husbands eyes and said i will with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mothers heart rejoiced and aunt march sniffed audibly.  jo did not cry though she was very near it once and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that laurie was staring fixedly at her with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes. beth kept her face hidden on her mothers shoulder but amy stood like a graceful statue with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.  it wasnt at all the thing im afraid but the minute she was fairly married meg cried the first kiss for marmee and turning gave it with her heart on her lips. during the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent from mr. laurence to old hannah who adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made fell upon her in the hall crying with a sob and a chuckle bless you deary a hundred times the cake aint hurt a mite and everything looks lovely.  everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light. there was no display of gifts for they were already in the little house nor was there an elaborate breakfast but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit dressed with flowers. mr. laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water lemonade and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried round. no one said anything till laurie who insisted on serving the bride appeared before her with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.  has jo smashed all the bottles by accident he whispered or am i merely laboring under a delusion that i saw some lying about loose this morning  no your grandfather kindly offered us his best and aunt march actually sent some but father put away a little for beth and dispatched the rest to the soldiers home. you know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness and mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.  meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh but he did neither for after a quick look at her he said in his impetuous way i like that for ive seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do.  you are not made wise by experience i hope and there was an anxious accent in megs voice.  no. i give you my word for it. dont think too well of me either this is not one of my temptations. being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless i dont care for it but when a pretty girl offers it one doesnt like to refuse you see.  but you will for the sake of others if not for your own. come laurie promise and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life.  a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment for ridicule is often harder to bear than selfdenial. meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs and feeling her power used it as a woman may for her friends good. she did not speak but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness and a smile which said no one can refuse me anything today.  laurie certainly could not and with an answering smile he gave her his hand saying heartily i promise mrs. brooke  i thank you very very much.  and i drink long life to your resolution teddy cried jo baptizing him with a splash of lemonade as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him.  so the toast was drunk the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations for with instinctive wisdom the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service for which he thanked them all his life.  after lunch people strolled about by twos and threes through the house and garden enjoying the sunshine without and within. meg and john happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot when laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.  all the married people take hands and dance round the newmade husband and wife as the germans do while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside cried laurie promenading down the path with amy with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. mr. and mrs. march aunt and uncle carrol began it others rapidly joined in even sallie moffat after a moments hesitation threw her train over her arm and whisked ned into the ring. but the crowning joke was mr. laurence and aunt march for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady she just tucked her cane under her arm and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.  want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close and then people began to go.  i wish you well my dear i heartily wish you well but i think youll be sorry for it said aunt march to meg adding to the bridegroom as he led her to the carriage youve got a treasure young man see that you deserve it.  that is the prettiest wedding ive been to for an age ned and i dont see why for there wasnt a bit of style about it observed mrs. moffat to her husband as they drove away.  laurie my lad if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing get one of those little girls to help you and i shall be perfectly satisfied said mr. laurence settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.  ill do my best to gratify you sir was lauries unusually dutiful reply as he carefully unpinned the posy jo had put in his buttonhole.  the little house was not far away and the only bridal journey meg had was the quiet walk with john from the old home to the new. when she came down looking like a pretty quakeress in her dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white they all gathered about her to say goodby as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.  dont feel that i am separated from you marmee dear or that i love you any the less for loving john so much she said clinging to her mother with full eyes for a moment. i shall come every day father and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts though i am married. beth is going to be with me a great deal and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. thank you all for my happy wedding day. goodby goodby  they stood watching her with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away leaning on her husbands arm with her hands full of flowers and the june sunshine brightening her happy faceand so megs married life began.     chapter twentysix artistic attempts   it takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius especially ambitious young men and women. amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. for a long time there was a lull in the mudpie business and she devoted herself to the finest penandink drawing in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. but overstrained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at pokersketching. while this attack lasted the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency redhot pokers lay about promiscuously and hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. raphaels face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board and bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindling for some time.  from fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers and amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. an artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes brushes and colors and she daubed away producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea. her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. swarthy boys and darkeyed madonnas staring at you from one corner of the studio suggested murillo oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place meant rembrandt buxom ladies and dropiscal infants rubens and turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder orange lightning brown rain and purple clouds with a tomatocolored splash in the middle which might be the sun or a bouy a sailors shirt or a kings robe as the spectator pleased.  charcoal portraits came next and the entire family hung in a row looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. softened into crayon sketches they did better for the likenesses were good and amys hair jos nose megs mouth and lauries eyes were pronounced wonderfully fine. a return to clay and plaster followed and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house or tumbled off closet shelves onto peoples heads. children were enticed in as models till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused miss amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. her efforts in this line however were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident which quenched her ardor. other models failing her for a time she undertook to cast her own pretty foot and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far cut the poor foot and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt at least.  after this amy subsided till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river field and wood for picturesque studies and sighing for ruins to copy. she caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book a delicious bit composed of a stone a stump one mushroom and a broken mullein stalk or a heavenly mass of clouds that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. she sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after points of sight or whatever the squintandstring performance is called.  if genius is eternal patience as michelangelo affirms amy had some claim to the divine attribute for she persevered in spite of all obstacles failures and discouragements firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called high art.  she was learning doing and enjoying other things meanwhile for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman even if she never became a great artist. here she succeeded better for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort make friends everywhere and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. everybody liked her for among her good gifts was tact. she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper always said the right thing to the right person did just what suited the time and place and was so selfpossessed that her sisters used to say if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand shed know exactly what to do.  one of her weaknesses was a desire to move in our best society without being quite sure what the best really was. money position fashionable accomplishments and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes and she liked to associate with those who possessed them often mistaking the false for the true and admiring what was not admirable. never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her.  my lady as her friends called her sincerely desired to be a genuine lady and was so at heart but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature that rank does not always confer nobility and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.  i want to ask a favor of you mamma amy said coming in with an important air one day.  well little girl what is it replied her mother in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained the baby.  our drawing class breaks up next week and before the girls separate for the summer i want to ask them out here for a day. they are wild to see the river sketch the broken bridge and copy some of the things they admire in my book. they have been very kind to me in many ways and i am grateful for they are all rich and i know i am poor yet they never made any difference.  why should they and mrs. march put the question with what the girls called her maria theresa air.  you know as well as i that it does make a difference with nearly everyone so dont ruffle up like a dear motherly hen when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. the ugly duckling turned out a swan you know. and amy smiled without bitterness for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.  mrs. march laughed and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked well my swan what is your plan  i should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week to take them for a drive to the places they want to see a row on the river perhaps and make a little artistic fete for them.  that looks feasible. what do you want for lunch cake sandwiches fruit and coffee will be all that is necessary i suppose  oh dear no we must have cold tongue and chicken french chocolate and ice cream besides. the girls are used to such things and i want my lunch to be proper and elegant though i do work for my living.  how many young ladies are there asked her mother beginning to look sober.  twelve or fourteen in the class but i dare say they wont all come.  bless me child you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about.  why mother how can you think of such a thing not more than six or eight will probably come so i shall hire a beach wagon and borrow mr. laurences cherrybounce. hannahs pronunciation of charabanc.  all of this will be expensive amy.  not very. ive calculated the cost and ill pay for it myself.  dont you think dear that as these girls are used to such things and the best we can do will be nothing new that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them as a change if nothing more and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we dont need and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances  if i cant have it as i like i dont care to have it at all. i know that i can carry it out perfectly well if you and the girls will help a little and i dont see why i cant if im willing to pay for it said amy with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy.  mrs. march knew that experience was an excellent teacher and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.  very well amy if your heart is set upon it and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money time and temper ill say no more. talk it over with the girls and whichever way you decide ill do my best to help you.  thanks mother you are always so kind. and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters.  meg agreed at once and promised her aid gladly offering anything she possessed from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first.  why in the world should you spend your money worry your family and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who dont care a sixpence for you i thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears french boots and rides in a coupe said jo who being called from the tragic climax of her novel was not in the best mood for social enterprises.  i dont truckle and i hate being patronized as much as you do returned amy indignantly for the two still jangled when such questions arose. the girls do care for me and i for them and theres a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. you dont care to make people like you to go into good society and cultivate your manners and tastes. i do and i mean to make the most of every chance that comes. you can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air and call it independence if you like. thats not my way.  when amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side while jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument. amys definition of jos idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing and the discussion took a more amiable turn. much against her will jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to mrs. grundy and help her sister through what she regarded as a nonsensical business.  the invitations were sent nearly all accepted and the following monday was set apart for the grand event. hannah was out of humor because her weeks work was deranged and prophesied that ef the washin and ironin warnt done reglar nothin would go well anywheres. this hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern but amys motto was nil desperandum and having made up her mind what to do she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. to begin with hannahs cooking didnt turn out well. the chicken was tough the tongue too salty and the chocolate wouldnt froth properly. then the cake and ice cost more than amy expected so did the wagon and various other expenses which seemed trifling at the outset counted up rather alarmingly afterward. beth got a cold and took to her bed. meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home and jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages accidents and mistakes were uncommonly numerous serious and trying.  if it was not fair on monday the young ladies were to come on tuesday an arrangement which aggravated jo and hannah to the last degree. on monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour. it drizzled a little shone a little blew a little and didnt make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. amy was up at dawn hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts that the house might be got in order. the parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby but without stopping to sigh for what she had not she skillfully made the best of what she had arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary which gave an artistic air to the room as did the lovely vases of flowers jo scattered about.  the lunch looked charming and as she surveyed it she sincerely hoped it would taste well and that the borrowed glass china and silver would get safely home again. the carriages were promised meg and mother were all ready to do the honors beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind and aching head and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow and as she wearily dressed amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when lunch safely over she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights for the cherry bounce and the broken bridge were her strong points.  then came the hours of suspense during which she vibrated from parlor to porch while public opinion varied like the weathercock. a smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve for nobody came and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast that nothing might be lost.  no doubt about the weather today they will certainly come so we must fly round and be ready for them said amy as the sun woke her next morning. she spoke briskly but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about tuesday for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale.  i cant get any lobsters so you will have to do without salad today said mr. march coming in half an hour later with an expression of placid despair.  use the chicken then the toughness wont matter in a salad advised his wife.  hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute and the kittens got at it. im very sorry amy added beth who was still a patroness of cats.  then i must have a lobster for tongue alone wont do said amy decidedly.  shall i rush into town and demand one asked jo with the magnanimity of a martyr.  youd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper just to try me. ill go myself answered amy whose temper was beginning to fail.  shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket she departed feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. after some delay the object of her desire was procured likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home and off she drove again well pleased with her own forethought.  as the omnibus contained only one other passenger a sleepy old lady amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to. so busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer who entered without stopping the vehicle till a masculine voice said good morning miss march and looking up she beheld one of lauries most elegant college friends. fervently hoping that he would get out before she did amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress returned the young mans greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.  they got on excellently for amys chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain when the old lady got out. in stumbling to the door she upset the basket andoh horrorthe lobster in all its vulgar size and brilliancy was revealed to the highborn eyes of a tudor  by jove shes forgotten her dinner cried the unconscious youth poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.  please dontitsits mine murmured amy with a face nearly as red as her fish.  oh really i beg pardon. its an uncommonly fine one isnt it said tudor with great presence of mind and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding.  amy recovered herself in a breath set her basket boldly on the seat and said laughing dont you wish you were to have some of the salad hes going to make and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it  now that was tact for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched. the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences and curiosity about the charming young ladies diverted his mind from the comical mishap.  i suppose hell laugh and joke over it with laurie but i shant see them thats a comfort thought amy as tudor bowed and departed.  she did not mention this meeting at home though she discovered that thanks to the upset her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before and at twelve oclock all was ready again. feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements she wished to efface the memory of yesterdays failure by a grand success today so she ordered the cherry bounce and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.  theres the rumble theyre coming ill go onto the porch and meet them. it looks hospitable and i want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble said mrs. march suiting the action to the word. but after one glance she retired with an indescribable expression for looking quite lost in the big carriage sat amy and one young lady.  run beth and help hannah clear half the things off the table. it will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl cried jo hurrying away to the lower regions too excited to stop even for a laugh.  in came amy quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise. the rest of the family being of a dramatic turn played their parts equally well and miss eliott found them a most hilarious set for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. the remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of the studio and garden visited and art discussed with enthusiasm amy ordered a buggy alas for the elegant cherrybounce and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset when the party went out.  as she came walking in looking very tired but as composed as ever she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared except a suspicious pucker about the corners of jos mouth.  youve had a loverly afternoon for your drive dear said her mother as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.  miss eliott is a very sweet girl and seemed to enjoy herself i thought observed beth with unusual warmth.  could you spare me some of your cake i really need some i have so much company and i cant make such delicious stuff as yours asked meg soberly.  take it all. im the only one here who likes sweet things and it will mold before i can dispose of it answered amy thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.  its a pity laurie isnt here to help us began jo as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.  a warning look from her mother checked any further remarks and the whole family ate in heroic silence till mr. march mildly observed salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients and evelyn... here a general explosion of laughter cut short the history of salads to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.  bundle everything into a basket and send it to the hummels. germans like messes. im sick of the sight of this and theres no reason you should all die of a surfeit because ive been a fool cried amy wiping her eyes.  i thought i should have died when i saw you two girls rattling about in the whatyoucallit like two little kernels in a very big nutshell and mother waiting in state to receive the throng sighed jo quite spent with laughter.  im very sorry you were disappointed dear but we all did our best to satisfy you said mrs. march in a tone full of motherly regret.  i am satisfied. ive done what i undertook and its not my fault that it failed. i comfort myself with that said amy with a little quiver in her voice. i thank you all very much for helping me and ill thank you still more if you wont allude to it for a month at least.  no one did for several months but the word fete always produced a general smile and lauries birthday gift to amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.     chapter twentyseven literary lessons   fortune suddenly smiled upon jo and dropped a good luck penny in her path. not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise.  every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room put on her scribbling suit and fall into a vortex as she expressed it writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul for till that was finished she could find no peace. her scribbling suit consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will and a cap of the same material adorned with a cheerful red bow into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family who during these periods kept their distance merely popping in their heads semioccasionally to ask with interest does genius burn jo they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly. if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead it was a sign that hard work was going on in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off and cast upon the floor. at such times the intruder silently withdrew and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow did anyone dare address jo.  she did not think herself a genius by any means but when the writing fit came on she gave herself up to it with entire abandon and led a blissful life unconscious of want care or bad weather while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. sleep forsook her eyes meals stood untasted day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times and made these hours worth living even if they bore no other fruit. the divine afflatus usually lasted a week or two and then she emerged from her vortex hungry sleepy cross or despondent.  she was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort miss crocker to a lecture and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. it was a peoples course the lecture on the pyramids and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx.  they were early and while miss crocker set the heel of her stocking jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them. on her left were two matrons with massive foreheads and bonnets to match discussing womens rights and making tatting. beyond sat a pair of humble lovers artlessly holding each other by the hand a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. on her right her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.  it was a pictorial sheet and jo examined the work of art nearest her idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat while two infuriated young gentlemen with unnaturally small feet and big eyes were stabbing each other close by and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open. pausing to turn a page the lad saw her looking and with boyish good nature offered half his paper saying bluntly want to read it thats a firstrate story.  jo accepted it with a smile for she had never outgrown her liking for lads and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love mystery and murder for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday and when the authors invention fails a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.  prime isnt it asked the boy as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion.  i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried returned jo amused at his admiration of the trash.  i should think i was a pretty lucky chap if i could. she makes a good living out of such stories they say. and he pointed to the name of mrs. s.l.a.n.g. northbury under the title of the tale.  do you know her asked jo with sudden interest.  no but i read all her pieces and i know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed.  do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.  guess she does she knows just what folks like and gets paid well for writing it.  here the lecture began but jo heard very little of it for while professor sands was prosing away about belzoni cheops scarabei and hieroglyphics she was covertly taking down the address of the paper and boldly resolving to try for the hundreddollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational story. by the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke she had built up a splendid fortune for herself not the first founded on paper and was already deep in the concoction of her story being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder.  she said nothing of her plan at home but fell to work next day much to the disquiet of her mother who always looked a little anxious when genius took to burning. jo had never tried this style before contenting herself with very mild romances for the spread eagle. her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect and supplied plot language and costumes. her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it and having located it in lisbon she wound up with an earthquake as a striking and appropriate denouement. the manuscript was privately dispatched accompanied by a note modestly saying that if the tale didnt get the prize which the writer hardly dared expect she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.  six weeks is a long time to wait and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret but jo did both and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away for on opening it a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry. if the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature i think he would devote his leisure hours if he has any to that amusement for jo valued the letter more than the money because it was encouraging and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something though it was only to write a sensation story.  a prouder young woman was seldom seen than she when having composed herself she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand the check in the other announcing that she had won the prize. of course there was a great jubilee and when the story came everyone read and praised it though after her father had told her that the language was good the romance fresh and hearty and the tragedy quite thrilling he shook his head and said in his unworldly way...  you can do better than this jo. aim at the highest and never mind the money.  i think the money is the best part of it. what will you do with such a fortune asked amy regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye.  send beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two answered jo promptly.  to the seaside they went after much discussion and though beth didnt come home as plump and rosy as could be desired she was much better while mrs. march declared she felt ten years younger. so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money and fell to work with a cheery spirit bent on earning more of those delightful checks. she did earn several that year and began to feel herself a power in the house for by the magic of a pen her rubbish turned into comforts for them all. the dukes daughter paid the butchers bill a phantom hand put down a new carpet and the curse of the coventrys proved the blessing of the marches in the way of groceries and gowns.  wealth is certainly a most desirable thing but poverty has its sunny side and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand and to the inspiration of necessity we owe half the wise beautiful and useful blessings of the world. jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny.  little notice was taken of her stories but they found a market and encouraged by this fact she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune. having copied her novel for the fourth time read it to all her confidential friends and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers she at last disposed of it on condition that she would cut it down one third and omit all the parts which she particularly admired.  now i must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold pay for printing it myself or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what i can for it. fame is a very good thing to have in the house but cash is more convenient so i wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject said jo calling a family council.  dont spoil your book my girl for there is more in it than you know and the idea is well worked out. let it wait and ripen was her fathers advice and he practiced what he preached having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.  it seems to me that jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting said mrs. march. criticism is the best test of such work for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults and help her to do better next time. we are too partial but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful even if she gets but little money.  yes said jo knitting her brows thats just it. ive been fussing over the thing so long i really dont know whether its good bad or indifferent. it will be a great help to have cool impartial persons take a look at it and tell me what they think of it.  i wouldnt leave a word out of it. youll spoil it if you do for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people and it will be all a muddle if you dont explain as you go on said meg who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written.  but mr. allen says leave out the explanations make it brief and dramatic and let the characters tell the story interrupted jo turning to the publishers note.  do as he tells you. he knows what will sell and we dont. make a good popular book and get as much money as you can. byandby when youve got a name you can afford to digress and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels said amy who took a strictly practical view of the subject.  well said jo laughing if my people are philosophical and metaphysical it isnt my fault for i know nothing about such things except what i hear father say sometimes. if ive got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance so much the better for me. now beth what do you say  i should so like to see it printed soon was all beth said and smiled in saying it. but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor which chilled jos heart for a minute with a forboding fear and decided her to make her little venture soon.  so with spartan firmness the young authoress laid her firstborn on her table and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. in the hope of pleasing everyone she took everyones advice and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.  her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it. her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description. out therefore it came and with it many necessary links in the story. meg admired the tragedy so jo piled up the agony to suit her while amy objected to the fun and with the best intentions in life jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story. then to complicate the ruin she cut it down one third and confidingly sent the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate.  well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover.  you said mother that criticism would help me. but how can it when its so contradictory that i dont know whether ive written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dismay the next. this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness. all is sweet pure and healthy. continued the perplexed authoress. the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters. now as i had no theory of any kind dont believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i dont see how this critic can be right. another says its one of the best american novels which has appeared for years. i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book. tisnt some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. i wish id printed the whole or not at all for i do hate to be so misjudged.  her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally. yet it was a hard time for sensitive highspirited jo who meant so well and had apparently done so ill. but it did her good for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an authors best education and when the first soreness was over she could laugh at her poor little book yet believe in it still and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.  not being a genius like keats it wont kill me she said stoutly and ive got the joke on my side after all for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced charmingly natural tender and true. so ill comfort myself with that and when im ready ill up again and take another.     chapter twentyeight domestic experiences   like most other young matrons meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper. john should find home a paradise he should always see a smiling face should fare sumptuously every day and never know the loss of a button. she brought so much love energy and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed in spite of some obstacles. her paradise was not a tranquil one for the little woman fussed was overanxious to please and bustled about like a true martha cumbered with many cares. she was too tired sometimes even to smile john grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare. as for buttons she soon learned to wonder where they went to shake her head over the carelessness of men and to threaten to make him sew them on himself and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers.  they were very happy even after they discovered that they couldnt live on love alone. john did not find megs beauty diminished though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot. nor did meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry shall i send some veal or mutton for dinner darling the little house ceased to be a glorified bower but it became a home and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better. at first they played keephouse and frolicked over it like children. then john took steadily to business feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders and meg laid by her cambric wrappers put on a big apron and fell to work as before said with more energy than discretion.  while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs. corneliuss receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise working out the problems with patience and care. sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes or lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little hummels. an evening with john over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm and a frugal fit would ensue during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding hash and warmedover coffee which tried his soul although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. before the golden mean was found however meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without a family jar.  fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. john was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once. as john firmly believed that my wife was equal to anything and took a natural pride in her skill he resolved that she should be gratified and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. home came four dozen delightful little pots half a barrel of sugar and a small boy to pick the currants for her. with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap arms bared to the elbow and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib the young housewife fell to work feeling no doubts about her success for hadnt she seen hannah do it hundreds of times the array of pots rather amazed her at first but john was so fond of jelly and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf that meg resolved to fill them all and spent a long day picking boiling straining and fussing over her jelly. she did her best she asked advice of mrs. cornelius she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she left undone she reboiled resugared and restrained but that dreadful stuff wouldnt jell.  she longed to run home bib and all and ask mother to lend her a hand but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries experiments or quarrels. they had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one but they had held to their resolve and whenever they could get on without help they did so and no one interfered for mrs. march had advised the plan. so meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day and at five oclock sat down in her topsyturvey kitchen wrung her bedaubed hands lifted up her voice and wept.  now in the first flush of the new life she had often said my husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes. i shall always be prepared. there shall be no flurry no scolding no discomfort but a neat house a cheerful wife and a good dinner. john dear never stop to ask my leave invite whom you please and be sure of a welcome from me.  how charming that was to be sure john quite glowed with pride to hear her say it and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife. but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. it always happens so in this vale of tears there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at deplore and bear as we best can.  if john had not forgotten all about the jelly it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day of all the days in the year to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce when his pretty wife came running out to meet him he escorted his friend to his mansion with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.  it is a world of disappointments as john discovered when he reached the dovecote. the front door usually stood hospitably open. now it was not only shut but locked and yesterdays mud still adorned the steps. the parlor windows were closed and curtained no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza in white with a distracting little bow in her hair or a brighteyed hostess smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest. nothing of the sort for not a soul appeared but a sanginarylooking boy asleep under the current bushes.  im afraid something has happened. step into the garden scott while i look up mrs. brooke said john alarmed at the silence and solitude.  round the house he hurried led by a pungent smell of burned sugar and mr. scott strolled after him with a queer look on his face. he paused discreetly at a distance when brooke disappeared but he could both see and hear and being a bachelor enjoyed the prospect mightily.  in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot another lay upon the floor and a third was burning gaily on the stove. lotty with teutonic phlegm was calmly eating bread and currant wine for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state while mrs. brooke with her apron over her head sat sobbing dismally.  my dearest girl what is the matter cried john rushing in with awful visions of scalded hands sudden news of affliction and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.  oh john i am so tired and hot and cross and worried ive been at it till im all worn out. do come and help me or i shall die and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.  what worries you dear has anything dreadful happened asked the anxious john tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap which was all askew.  yes sobbed meg despairingly.  tell me quick then. dont cry. i can bear anything better than that. out with it love.  the... the jelly wont jell and i dont know what to do  john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal which put the finishing stroke to poor megs woe.  is that all fling it out of the window and dont bother any more about it. ill buy you quarts if you want it but for heavens sake dont have hysterics for ive brought jack scott home to dinner and...  john got no further for meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay...  a man to dinner and everything in a mess john brooke how could you do such a thing  hush hes in the garden i forgot the confounded jelly but it cant be helped now said john surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.  you ought to have sent word or told me this morning and you ought to have remembered how busy i was continued meg petulantly for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.  i didnt know it this morning and there was no time to send word for i met him on the way out. i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked. i never tried it before and hang me if i ever do again added john with an aggrieved air.  i should hope not take him away at once. i cant see him and there isnt any dinner.  well i like that wheres the beef and vegetables i sent home and the pudding you promised cried john rushing to the larder.  i hadnt time to cook anything. i meant to dine at mothers. im sorry but i was so busy and megs tears began again.  john was a mild man but he was human and after a long days work to come home tired hungry and hopeful to find a chaotic house an empty table and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner. he restrained himself however and the little squall would have blown over but for one unlucky word.  its a scrape i acknowledge but if you will lend a hand well pull through and have a good time yet. dont cry dear but just exert yourself a bit and fix us up something to eat. were both as hungry as hunters so we shant mind what it is. give us the cold meat and bread and cheese. we wont ask for jelly.  he meant it to be a goodnatured joke but that one word sealed his fate. meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.  you must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. im too used up to exert myself for anyone. its like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. i wont have anything of the sort in my house. take that scott up to mothers and tell him im away sick dead anything. i wont see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. you wont have anything else here. and having delivered her defiance all on one breath meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room.  what those two creatures did in her absence she never knew but mr. scott was not taken up to mothers and when meg descended after they had strolled away together she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror. lotty reported that they had eaten a much and greatly laughed and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff and hide the pots.  meg longed to go and tell mother but a sense of shame at her own shortcomings of loyalty to john who might be cruel but nobody should know it restrained her and after a summary cleaning up she dressed herself prettily and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven.  unfortunately john didnt come not seeing the matter in that light. he had carried it off as a good joke with scott excused his little wife as well as he could and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner and promised to come again but john was angry though he did not show it he felt that meg had deserted him in his hour of need. it wasnt fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time with perfect freedom and when he took you at your word to flame up and blame him and leave him in the lurch to be laughed at or pitied. no by george it wasnt and meg must know it.  he had fumed inwardly during the feast but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing scott off a milder mood came over him. poor little thing it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me. she was wrong of course but then she was young. i must be patient and teach her. he hoped she had not gone homehe hated gossip and interference. for a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it and then the fear that meg would cry herself sick softened his heart and sent him on at a quicker pace resolving to be calm and kind but firm quite firm and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.  meg likewise resolved to be calm and kind but firm and show him his duty. she longed to run to meet him and beg pardon and be kissed and comforted as she was sure of being but of course she did nothing of the sort and when she saw john coming began to hum quite naturally as she rocked and sewed like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.  john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology he made none only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark we are going to have a new moon my dear.  ive no objection was megs equally soothing remark. a few other topics of general interest were introduced by mr. brooke and wetblanketed by mrs. brooke and conversation languished. john went to one window unfolded his paper and wrapped himself in it figuratively speaking. meg went to the other window and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. neither spoke. both looked quite calm and firm and both felt desperately uncomfortable.  oh dear thought meg married life is very trying and does need infinite patience as well as love as mother says. the word mother suggested other maternal counsels given long ago and received with unbelieving protests.  john is a good man but he has his faults and you must learn to see and bear with them remembering your own. he is very decided but never will be obstinate if you reason kindly not oppose impatiently. he is very accurate and particular about the trutha good trait though you call him fussy. never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need. he has a temper not like oursone flash and then all overbut the white still anger that is seldom stirred but once kindled is hard to quench. be careful be very careful not to wake his anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. watch yourself be the first to ask pardon if you both err and guard against the little piques misunderstandings and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret.  these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last. this was the first serious disagreement her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind as she recalled them her own anger looked childish now and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them. she put down her work and got up thinking i will be the first to say forgive me but he did not seem to hear her. she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head. for a minute she felt as if she really couldnt do it then came the thought this is the beginning. ill do my part and have nothing to reproach myself with and stooping down she softly kissed her husband on the forehead. of course that settled it. the penitent kiss was better than a world of words and john had her on his knee in a minute saying tenderly...  it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. forgive me dear. i never will again  but he did oh bless you yes hundreds of times and so did meg both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.  after this meg had mr. scott to dinner by special invitation and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course on which occasion she was so gay and gracious and made everything go off so charmingly that mr. scott told john he was a lucky fellow and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home.  in the autumn new trials and experiences came to meg. sallie moffat renewed her friendship was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house or inviting that poor dear to come in and spend the day at the big house. it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely. all were busy at home john absent till night and nothing to do but sew or read or potter about. so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. seeing sallies pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them. sallie was very kind and often offered her the coveted trifles but meg declined them knowing that john wouldnt like it and then this foolish little woman went and did what john disliked even worse.  she knew her husbands income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value morehis money. she knew where it was was free to take what she liked and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny pay bills once a month and remember that she was a poor mans wife. till now she had done well been prudent and exact kept her little account books neatly and showed them to him monthly without fear. but that autumn the serpent got into megs paradise and tempted her like many a modern eve not with apples but with dress. meg didnt like to be pitied and made to feel poor. it irritated her but she was ashamed to confess it and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty so that sallie neednt think she had to economize. she always felt wicked after it for the pretty things were seldom necessaries but then they cost so little it wasnt worth worrying about so the trifles increased unconsciously and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive lookeron.  but the trifles cost more than one would imagine and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her. john was busy that month and left the bills to her the next month he was absent but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up and meg never forgot it. a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience. sallie had been buying silks and meg longed for a new one just a handsome light one for parties her black silk was so common and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls. aunt march usually gave the sisters a present of twentyfive dollars apiece at new years. that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it. john always said what was his was hers but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective fiveandtwenty but another fiveandtwenty out of the household fund that was the question. sallie had urged her to do it had offered to lend the money and with the best intentions in life had tempted meg beyond her strength. in an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely shimmering folds and said a bargain i assure you maam. she answered ill take it and it was cut off and paid for and sallie had exulted and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence and driven away feeling as if she had stolen something and the police were after her.  when she got home she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk but it looked less silvery now didnt become her after all and the words fifty dollars seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth. she put it away but it haunted her not delightfully as a new dress should but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. when john got out his books that night megs heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband. the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but didnt mean to let her know it. the house bills were all paid the books all in order. john had praised her and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the bank when meg knowing that it was quite empty stopped his hand saying nervously...  you havent seen my private expense book yet.  john never asked to see it but she always insisted on his doing so and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted and made him guess what piping was demand fiercely the meaning of a hugmetight or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds a bit of velvet and a pair of strings could possibly be a bonnet and cost six dollars. that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance as he often did being particularly proud of his prudent wife.  the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead and standing there she said with her panic increasing with every word...  john dear im ashamed to show you my book for ive really been dreadfully extravagant lately. i go about so much i must have things you know and sallie advised my getting it so i did and my new years money will partly pay for it but i was sorry after i had done it for i knew youd think it wrong in me.  john laughed and drew her round beside him saying goodhumoredly dont go and hide. i wont beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots. im rather proud of my wifes feet and dont mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots if they are good ones.  that had been one of her last trifles and johns eye had fallen on it as he spoke. oh what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars thought meg with a shiver.  its worse than boots its a silk dress she said with the calmness of desperation for she wanted the worst over.  well dear what is the demd total as mr. mantalini says  that didnt sound like john and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now. she turned the page and her head at the same time pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty but which was appalling to her with that added. for a minute the room was very still then john said slowlybut she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure. . .  well i dont know that fifty is much for a dress with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.  it isnt made or trimmed sighed meg faintly for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.  twentyfive yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman but ive no doubt my wife will look as fine as ned moffats when she gets it on said john dryly.  i know you are angry john but i cant help it. i dont mean to waste your money and i didnt think those little things would count up so. i cant resist them when i see sallie buying all she wants and pitying me because i dont. i try to be contented but it is hard and im tired of being poor.  the last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them but he did and they wounded him deeply for he had denied himself many pleasures for megs sake. she could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it for john pushed the books away and got up saying with a little quiver in his voice i was afraid of this. i do my best meg. if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words. she ran to him and held him close crying with repentant tears oh john my dear kind hardworking boy. i didnt mean it it was so wicked so untrue and ungrateful how could i say it oh how could i say it  he was very kind forgave her readily and did not utter one reproach but meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon although he might never allude to it again. she had promised to love him for better or worse and then she his wife had reproached him with his poverty after spending his earnings recklessly. it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep. a week of remorse nearly made meg sick and the discovery that john had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold. he had simply said in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change i cant afford it my dear.  meg said no more but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat crying as if her heart would break.  they had a long talk that night and meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty because it seemed to have made a man of him given him the strength and courage to fight his own way and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved.  next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. the goodnatured mrs. moffat willingly did so and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward. then meg ordered home the greatcoat and when john arrived she put it on and asked him how he liked her new silk gown. one can imagine what answer he made how he received his present and what a blissful state of things ensued. john came home early meg gadded no more and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife. so the year rolled round and at midsummer there came to meg a new experience the deepest and tenderest of a womans life.  laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday with an excited face and was received with the clash of cymbals for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other.  hows the little mamma where is everybody why didnt you tell me before i came home began laurie in a loud whisper.  happy as a queen the dear every soul of em is upstairs a worshipin. we didnt want no hurrycanes round. now you go into the parlor and ill send em down to you with which somewhat involved reply hannah vanished chuckling ecstatically.  presently jo appeared proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. jos face was very sober but her eyes twinkled and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.  shut your eyes and hold out your arms she said invitingly.  laurie backed precipitately into a corner and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture. no thank you. id rather not. i shall drop it or smash it as sure as fate.  then you shant see your nevvy said jo decidedly turning as if to go.  i will i will only you must be responsible for damages. and obeying orders laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms. a peal of laughter from jo amy mrs. march hannah and john caused him to open them the next minute to find himself invested with two babies instead of one.  no wonder they laughed for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed.  twins by jupiter was all he said for a minute then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous he added take em quick somebody im going to laugh and i shall drop em.  jo rescued his babies and marched up and down with one on each arm as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending while laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.  its the best joke of the season isnt it i wouldnt have told you for i set my heart on surprising you and i flatter myself ive done it said jo when she got her breath.  i never was more staggered in my life. isnt it fun are they boys what are you going to name them lets have another look. hold me up jo for upon my life its one too many for me returned laurie regarding the infants with the air of a big benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens.  boy and girl. arent they beauties said the proud papa beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.  most remarkable children i ever saw. which is which and laurie bent like a wellsweep to examine the prodigies.  amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl french fashion so you can always tell. besides one has blue eyes and one brown. kiss them uncle teddy said wicked jo.  im afraid they mightnt like it began laurie with unusual timidity in such matters.  of course they will they are used to it now. do it this minute sir commanded jo fearing he might propose a proxy.  laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh and made the babies squeal.  there i knew they didnt like it thats the boy see him kick he hits out with his fists like a good one. now then young brooke pitch into a man of your own size will you cried laurie delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist flapping aimlessly about.  hes to be named john laurence and the girl margaret after mother and grandmother. we shall call her daisey so as not to have two megs and i suppose the mannie will be jack unless we find a better name said amy with auntlike interest.  name him demijohn and call him demi for short said laurie.  daisy and demi just the thing i knew teddy would do it cried jo clapping her hands.  teddy certainly had done it that time for the babies were daisy and demi to the end of the chapter.     chapter twentynine calls   come jo its time.  for what  you dont mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today  ive done a good many rash and foolish things in my life but i dont think i ever was mad enough to say id make six calls in one day when a single one upsets me for a week.  yes you did it was a bargain between us. i was to finish the crayon of beth for you and you were to go properly with me and return our neighbors visits.  if it was fair that was in the bond and i stand to the letter of my bond shylock. there is a pile of clouds in the east its not fair and i dont go.  now thats shirking. its a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months.  at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was mantuamaker general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen. it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day. she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise. in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelled thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready.  jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you dont intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement.  why not im neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i dont wish to see them. you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please. it pays for you to be fine. it doesnt for me and furbelows only worry me.  oh dear sighed amy now shes in a contrary fit and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready. im sure its no pleasure to me to go today but its a debt we owe society and theres no one to pay it but you and me. ill do anything for you jo if youll only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil. you can talk so well look so aristocratic in your best things and behave so beautifully if you try that im proud of you. im afraid to go alone do come and take care of me.  youre an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way. the idea of my being aristocratic and wellbred and your being afraid to go anywhere alone i dont know which is the most absurd. well ill go if i must and do my best. you shall be commander of the expedition and ill obey blindly will that satisfy you said jo with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission.  youre a perfect cherub now put on all your best things and ill tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression. i want people to like you and they would if youd only try to be a little more agreeable. do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet. its becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit. take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. well stop at megs and borrow her white sunshade and then you can have my dovecolored one.  while amy dressed she issued her orders and jo obeyed them not without entering her protest however for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel as the last touch of elegance she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance saying meekly...  im perfectly miserable but if you consider me presentable i die happy.  youre highly satisfactory. turn slowly round and let me get a careful view. jo revolved and amy gave a touch here and there then fell back with her head on one side observing graciously yes youll do. your head is all i could ask for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. hold back your shoulders and carry your hands easily no matter if your gloves do pinch. theres one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawl. i cant but its very nice to see you and im so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one. its simple but handsome and those folds over the arm are really artistic. is the point of my mantle in the middle and have i looped my dress evenly i like to show my boots for my feet are pretty though my nose isnt.  you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever said jo looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. am i to drag my best dress through the dust or loop it up please maam  hold it up when you walk but drop it in the house. the sweeping style suits you best and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. you havent half buttoned one cuff do it at once. youll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details for they make up the pleasing whole.  jo sighed and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove in doing up her cuff but at last both were ready and sailed away looking as pretty as picters hannah said as she hung out of the upper window to watch them.  now jo dear the chesters consider themselves very elegant people so i want you to put on your best deportment. dont make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you just be calm cool and quiet thats safe and ladylike and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes said amy as they approached the first place having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by meg with a baby on each arm.  let me see. calm cool and quiet yes i think i can promise that. ive played the part of a prim young lady on the stage and ill try it off. my powers are great as you shall see so be easy in your mind my child.  amy looked relieved but naughty jo took her at her word for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed every fold correctly draped calm as a summer sea cool as a snowbank and as silent as the sphinx. in vain mrs. chester alluded to her charming novel and the misses chester introduced parties picnics the opera and the fashions. each and all were answered by a smile a bow and a demure yes or no with the chill on. in vain amy telegraphed the word talk tried to draw her out and administered covert pokes with her foot. jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all with deportment like mauds face icily regular splendidly null.  what a haughty uninteresting creature that oldest miss march is was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies as the door closed upon their guests. jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall but amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions and very naturally laid the blame upon jo.  how could you mistake me so i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone. try to be sociable at the lambs. gossip as other girls do and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up. they move in the best society are valuable persons for us to know and i wouldnt fail to make a good impression there for anything.  ill be agreeable. ill gossip and giggle and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like. i rather enjoy this and now ill imitate what is called a charming girl. i can do it for i have may chester as a model and ill improve upon her. see if the lambs dont say what a lively nice creature that jo march is  amy felt anxious as well she might for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop. amys face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room kiss all the young ladies with effusion beam graciously upon the young gentlemen and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. amy was taken possession of by mrs. lamb with whom she was a favorite and forced to hear a long account of lucretias last attack while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. so situated she was powerless to check jo who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief and talked away as volubly as the lady. a knot of heads gathered about her and amy strained her ears to hear what was going on for broken sentences filled her with curiosity and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. one may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation.  she rides splendidly. who taught her  no one. she used to practice mounting holding the reins and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. now she rides anything for she doesnt know what fear is and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. she has such a passion for it i often tell her if everything else fails she can be a horsebreaker and get her living so.  at this awful speech amy contained herself with difficulty for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady which was her especial aversion. but what could she do for the old lady was in the middle of her story and long before it was done jo was off again making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders.  yes amy was in despair that day for all the good beasts were gone and of three left one was lame one blind and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. nice animal for a pleasure party wasnt it  which did she choose asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject.  none of them. she heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river and though a lady had never ridden him she resolved to try because he was handsome and spirited. her struggles were really pathetic. there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse. my dear creature she actually rowed it over the river put it on her head and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man  did she ride the horse  of course she did and had a capital time. i expected to see her brought home in fragments but she managed him perfectly and was the life of the party.  well i call that plucky and young mr. lamb turned an approving glance upon amy wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable.  she was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago must needs answer with unnecessary frankness oh amy painted it. you cant buy those soft shades so we paint ours any color we like. its a great comfort to have an artistic sister.  isnt that an original idea cried miss lamb who found jo great fun.  thats nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. theres nothing the child cant do. why she wanted a pair of blue boots for sallies party so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw and they looked exactly like satin added jo with an air of pride in her sisters accomplishments that exasperated amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her.  we read a story of yours the other day and enjoyed it very much observed the elder miss lamb wishing to compliment the literary lady who did not look the character just then it must be confessed.  any mention of her works always had a bad effect upon jo who either grew rigid and looked offended or changed the subject with a brusque remark as now. sorry you could find nothing better to read. i write that rubbish because it sells and ordinary people like it. are you going to new york this winter  as miss lamb had enjoyed the story this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary. the minute it was made jo saw her mistake but fearing to make the matter worse suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure and did so with an abruptness that left three people with halffinished sentences in their mouths.  amy we must go. goodby dear do come and see us. we are pining for a visit. i dont dare to ask you mr. lamb but if you should come i dont think i shall have the heart to send you away.  jo said this with such a droll imitation of may chesters gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.  didnt i do well asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away.  nothing could have been worse was amys crushing reply. what possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle and the hats and boots and all the rest of it  why its funny and amuses people. they know we are poor so its no use pretending that we have grooms buy three or four hats a season and have things as easy and fine as they do.  you neednt go and tell them all our little shifts and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. you havent a bit of proper pride and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak said amy despairingly.  poor jo looked abashed and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.  how shall i behave here she asked as they approached the third mansion.  just as you please. i wash my hands of you was amys short answer.  then ill enjoy myself. the boys are at home and well have a comfortable time. goodness knows i need a little change for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution returned jo gruffly being disturbed by her failure to suit.  an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr. tudor who happened to be calling likewise jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. she listened to college stories with deep interest caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur agreed heartily that tom brown was a brick regardless of the improper form of praise and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to smile upon her as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs bearlike but affectionate and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired frenchwoman.  leaving her sister to her own devices amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her hearts content. mr. tudors uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord and amy regarded the whole family with great respect for in spite of her american birth and breeding she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of usthat unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellowhaired laddie some years ago and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old like that of a big son for an imperious little mother who held him while she could and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time and when the proper number of minutes had passed she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society and looked about for jo fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march.  it might have been worse but amy considered it bad. for jo sat on the grass with an encampment of boys about her and a dirtyfooted dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress as she related one of lauries pranks to her admiring audience. one small child was poking turtles with amys cherished parasol a second was eating gingerbread over jos best bonnet and a third playing ball with her gloves but all were enjoying themselves and when jo collected her damaged property to go her escort accompanied her begging her to come again it was such fun to hear about lauries larks.  capital boys arent they i feel quite young and brisk again after that. said jo strolling along with her hands behind her partly from habit partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.  why do you always avoid mr. tudor asked amy wisely refraining from any comment upon jos dilapidated appearance.  dont like him he puts on airs snubs his sisters worries his father and doesnt speak respectfully of his mother. laurie says he is fast and i dont consider him a desirable acquaintance so i let him alone.  you might treat him civilly at least. you gave him a cool nod and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to tommy chamberlain whose father keeps a grocery store. if you had just reversed the nod and the bow it would have been right said amy reprovingly.  no it wouldnt returned jo i neither like respect nor admire tudor though his grandfathers uncles nephews niece was a third cousin to a lord. tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever. i think well of him and like to show that i do for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels.  its no use trying to argue with you began amy.  not the least my dear interrupted jo so let us look amiable and drop a card here as the kings are evidently out for which im deeply grateful.  the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house and being told that the young ladies were engaged.  now let us go home and never mind aunt march today. we can run down there any time and its really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers when we are tired and cross.  speak for yourself if you please. aunt march likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style and making a formal call. its a little thing to do but it gives her pleasure and i dont believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. stoop down and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.  what a good girl you are amy said jo with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister which was fresh and spotless still. i wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you. i think of them but it takes too much time to do them so i wait for a chance to confer a great favor and let the small ones slip but they tell best in the end i fancy.  amy smiled and was mollified at once saying with a maternal air women should learn to be agreeable particularly poor ones for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. if youd remember that and practice it youd be better liked than i am because there is more of you.  im a crotchety old thing and always shall be but im willing to own that you are right only its easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i dont feel like it. its a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes isnt it  its a greater not to be able to hide them. i dont mind saying that i dont approve of tudor any more than you do but im not called upon to tell him so. neither are you and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.  but i think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men and how can they do it except by their manners preaching does not do any good as i know to my sorrow since ive had teddie to manage. but there are many little ways in which i can influence him without a word and i say we ought to do it to others if we can.  teddy is a remarkable boy and cant be taken as a sample of other boys said amy in a tone of solemn conviction which would have convulsed the remarkable boy if he had heard it. if we were belles or women of wealth and position we might do something perhaps but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we dont approve of them and smile upon another set because we do wouldnt have a particle of effect and we should only be considered odd and puritanical.  so we are to countenance things and people which we detest merely because we are not belles and millionaires are we thats a nice sort of morality.  i cant argue about it i only know that its the way of the world and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains. i dont like reformers and i hope you never try to be one.  i do like them and i shall be one if i can for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them. we cant agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new. you will get on the best but i shall have the liveliest time of it. i should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting i think.  well compose yourself now and dont worry aunt with your new ideas.  ill try not to but im always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her. its my doom and i cant help it.  they found aunt carrol with the old lady both absorbed in some very interesting subject but they dropped it as the girls came in with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces. jo was not in a good humor and the perverse fit returned but amy who had virtuously done her duty kept her temper and pleased everybody was in a most angelic frame of mind. this amiable spirit was felt at once and both aunts my deared her affectionately looking what they afterward said emphatically that child improves every day.  are you going to help about the fair dear asked mrs. carrol as amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young.  yes aunt. mrs. chester asked me if i would and i offered to tend a table as i have nothing but my time to give.  im not put in jo decidedly. i hate to be patronized and the chesters think its a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. i wonder you consented amy they only want you to work.  i am willing to work. its for the freedmen as well as the chesters and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.  quite right and proper. i like your grateful spirit my dear. its a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. some do not and that is trying observed aunt march looking over her spectacles at jo who sat apart rocking herself with a somewhat morose expression.  if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them she would have turned dovelike in a minute but unfortunately we dont have windows in our breasts and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper. by her next speech jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.  i dont like favors they oppress and make me feel like a slave. id rather do everything for myself and be perfectly independent.  ahem coughed aunt carrol softly with a look at aunt march.  i told you so said aunt march with a decided nod to aunt carrol.  mercifully unconscious of what she had done jo sat with her nose in the air and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.  do you speak french dear asked mrs. carrol laying a hand on amys.  pretty well thanks to aunt march who lets esther talk to me as often as i like replied amy with a grateful look which caused the old lady to smile affably.  how are you about languages asked mrs. carrol of jo.  dont know a word. im very stupid about studying anything cant bear french its such a slippery silly sort of language was the brusque reply.  another look passed between the ladies and aunt march said to amy you are quite strong and well now dear i believe eyes dont trouble you any more do they  not at all thank you maam. im very well and mean to do great things next winter so that i may be ready for rome whenever that joyful time arrives.  good girl you deserve to go and im sure you will some day said aunt march with an approving pat on the head as amy picked up her ball for her.  crosspatch draw the latch sit by the fire and spin   squalled polly bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into jos face with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.  most observing bird said the old lady.  come and take a walk my dear cried polly hopping toward the china closet with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.  thank you i will. come amy. and jo brought the visit to an end feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. she shook hands in a gentlemanly manner but amy kissed both the aunts and the girls departed leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine which impression caused aunt march to say as they vanished...  youd better do it mary. ill supply the money. and aunt carrol to reply decidedly i certainly will if her father and mother consent.     chapter thirty consequences   mrs. chesters fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and everyone was much interested in the matter. amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but amys talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.  everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some fiveandtwenty women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together.  may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. amys dainty penandink work entirely eclipsed mays painted vasesthat was one thorn. then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with maythat was thorn number two. but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs. all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape. no hint of this had reached the culprits however and amys dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs. chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look...  i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief gettersup of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place. im sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like.  mrs. chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with amys unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.  amy felt that there was something behind this but could not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all  now my dear dont have any ill feeling i beg. its merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place. i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere. wouldnt you like the flower table the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged. you could make a charming thing of it and the flower table is always attractive you know.  especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability...  it shall be as you please mrs. chester. ill give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like.  you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little consciencestricken as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly...  oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron pellmell she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.  now shes mad. oh dear i wish i hadnt asked you to speak mama said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.  girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might.  the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically. but everything seemed against her. it was late and she was tired. everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. the evergreen arch wouldnt stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. her best tile got a splash of water which left a sepia tear on the cupids cheek. she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draft which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task.  there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right. beth declared she wouldnt go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she didnt take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her.  because they are mean is no reason why i should be. i hate such things and though i think ive a right to be hurt i dont intend to show it. they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions wont they marmee  thats the right spirit my dear. a kiss for a blow is always best though its not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing.  in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely. as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  i ought but i dont thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to mays discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home. even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. amys conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice.  a group of girls were standing about mays table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen. they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it. she heard may say sorrowfully...  its too bad for there is no time to make other things and i dont want to fill up with odds and ends. the table was just complete then. now its spoiled.  i dare say shed put them back if you asked her suggested someone.  how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for amys voice came across the hall saying pleasantly...  you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them. i was just thinking id offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine. here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night.  as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.  now i call that lovely of her dont you cried one girl.  mays answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she wouldnt sell them at her own table.  now that was hard. when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. but it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.  it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon. few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night.  the art table was the most attractive in the room. there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do. it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.  she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done. her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. beth helped her dress and made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned.  dont do anything rude pray jo i wont have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table.  i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. teddy and his boys will lend a hand and well have a good time yet. returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie. presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him.  is that my boy  as sure as this is my girl and laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.  oh teddy such doings and jo told amys wrongs with sisterly zeal.  a flock of our fellows are going to drive over byandby and ill be hanged if i dont make them buy every flower shes got and camp down before her table afterward said laurie espousing her cause with warmth.  the flowers are not at all nice amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time. i dont wish to be unjust or suspicious but i shouldnt wonder if they never came at all. when people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed jo in a disgusted tone.  didnt hayes give you the best out of our gardens i told him to.  i didnt know that he forgot i suppose and as your grandpa was poorly i didnt like to worry him by asking though i did want some.  now jo how could you think there was any need of asking they are just as much yours as mine. dont we always go halves in everything began laurie in the tone that always made jo turn thorny.  gracious i hope not half of some of your things wouldnt suit me at all. but we mustnt stand philandering here. ive got to help amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if youll be so very kind as to let hayes take a few nice flowers up to the hall ill bless you forever.  couldnt you do it now asked laurie so suggestively that jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars go away teddy im busy.  thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. then the march family turned out en masse and jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring amys taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much. laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room. amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as spritely and gracious as possible coming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was its own reward after all.  jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor jo circulated about the hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the chester change of base. she reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate amy as soon as possible. she also discovered what amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity. as she passed the art table she glanced over it for her sisters things but saw no sign of them. tucked away out of sight i dare say thought jo who could forgive her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered her family.  good evening miss jo. how does amy get on asked may with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could be generous.  she has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself. the flower table is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen. jo couldnt resist giving that little slap but may took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold.  is amys illumination anywhere about i took a fancy to buy that for father said jo very anxious to learn the fate of her sisters work.  everything of amys sold long ago. i took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned may who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as amy had that day.  much gratified jo rushed back to tell the good news and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of mays word and manner.  now gentlemen i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine especially the art table she said ordering out teddys own as the girls called the college friends.  charge chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and youll get your moneys worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.  to hear is to obey but march is fairer far than may said little parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by laurie who said...  very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head.  buy the vases whispered amy to laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemys head.  to mays great delight mr. laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases.  aunt carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to mrs. march in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later.  the fair was pronounced a success and when may bade amy goodnight she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget. that satisfied amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. the reward of merit for a magnanimous march as laurie announced with a flourish.  youve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than i ever gave you credit for amy. youve behaved sweetly and i respect you with all my heart said jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night.  yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive. it must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things. i dont believe i could have done it as kindly as you did added beth from her pillow.  why girls you neednt praise me so. i only did as id be done by. you laugh at me when i say i want to be a lady but i mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and i try to do it as far as i know how. i cant explain exactly but i want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. im far from it now but i do my best and hope in time to be what mother is.  amy spoke earnestly and jo said with a cordial hug i understand now what you mean and ill never laugh at you again. you are getting on faster than you think and ill take lessons of you in true politeness for youve learned the secret i believe. try away deary youll get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than i shall.  a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted. a letter came from aunt carrol and mrs. marchs face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that jo and beth who were with her demanded what the glad tidings were.  aunt carrol is going abroad next month and wants...  me to go with her burst in jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture.  no dear not you. its amy.  oh mother shes too young its my turn first. ive wanted it so long. it would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid. i must go  im afraid its impossible jo. aunt says amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.  its always so. amy has all the fun and i have all the work. it isnt fair oh it isnt fair cried jo passionately.  im afraid its partly your own fault dear. when aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had saidi planned at first to ask jo but as favors burden her and she hates french i think i wont venture to invite her. amy is more docile will make a good companion for flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her.  oh my tongue my abominable tongue why cant i learn to keep it quiet groaned jo remembering words which had been her undoing. when she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases mrs. march said sorrowfully...  i wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and dont sadden amys pleasure by reproaches or regrets.  ill try said jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset. ill take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness. but it wont be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.  jo dear im very selfish but i couldnt spare you and im glad you are not going quite yet whispered beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg aunt carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it.  by the time amy came in jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at amys good fortune. the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself.  it isnt a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette. it will decide my career for if i have any genius i shall find it out in rome and will do something to prove it.  suppose you havent said jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy.  then i shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure. but she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.  no you wont. you hate hard work and youll marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said jo.  your predictions sometimes come to pass but i dont believe that one will. im sure i wish it would for if i cant be an artist myself i should like to be able to help those who are said amy smiling as if the part of lady bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher.  hum said jo with a sigh. if you wish it youll have it for your wishes are always grantedmine never.  would you like to go asked amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife.  rather  well in a year or two ill send for you and well dig in the forum for relics and carry out all the plans weve made so many times.  thank you. ill remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.  there was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till amy was off. jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she couldnt cry any more. amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed. then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob...  oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen...  i will dear i will and if anything happens ill come and comfort you whispered laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word.  so amy sailed away to find the old world which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happyhearted girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.     chapter thirtyone our foreign correspondent   london   dearest people here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly. its not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and wont go anywhere else. however we dont mean to stay long so its no great matter. oh i cant begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so ill only give you bits out of my notebook for ive done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started.   i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. everyone was very kind to me especially the officers. dont laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do its a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death im afraid.   aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself. such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly. i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good. as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the captains speaking trumpet shed have been in such a state of rapture.   it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and gentlemens countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks. it was early in the morning but i didnt regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead. i never shall forget it.   at queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us mr. lennox and when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and sung with a look at me...   oh have you eer heard of kate kearney she lives on the banks of killarney from the glance of her eye shun danger and fly for fatals the glance of kate kearney.   wasnt that nonsensical   we only stopped at liverpool a few hours. its a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it. uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved  la mutton chop the first thing. then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir. ive given em the latest yankee shine. it amused uncle immensely. oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert lennoxs compliments on the card. wasnt that fun girls i like traveling.   i never shall get to london if i dont hurry. the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes. the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors. the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood kneedeep in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies. such perfect color i never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark i was in a rapture all the way. so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and wouldnt be astonished at anything. this is the way we went on. amy flying upoh that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my windowhow sweet we must go there sometime wont we papa uncle calmly admiring his bootsno my dear not unless you want beer thats a brewery.   a pausethen flo cried out bless me theres a gallows and a man going up. where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains. a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye. heres a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy. see papa arent they pretty added flo sentimentally. geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of captain cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself.   of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers. aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i wasnt half ready. a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid. things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard. i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris. doesnt that sound sort of elegant and rich   flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it wasnt the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i couldnt get at him. he didnt hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace. at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said...   now then mum   i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral. i poked again and said a little faster then off he went helterskelter as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate.   today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look. the duke of devonshire lives near. i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of wellingtons house is not far off. such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front. smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them.   rotten row means route de roi or the kings way but now its more like a riding school than anything else. the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which isnt according to our rules. i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy noahs ark. everyone ridesold men stout ladies little childrenand the young folks do a deal of flirting here i saw a pair exchange rose buds for its the thing to wear one in the buttonhole and i thought it rather a nice little idea.   in the p.m. to westminster abbey but dont expect me to describe it thats impossible so ill only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.   its very late but i cant let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening. who do you think came in as we were at tea lauries english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i shouldnt have known them but for the cards. both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches. they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle wont go so we shall return the call and see them as we can. they went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had known each other all our days. tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health. fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat. neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there. what ages ago it seems doesnt it   aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop. i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness. i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving...   amy   paris   dear girls   in my last i told you about our london visit how kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us. i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else for at hampton i saw raphaels cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures. the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up. we did london to our hearts content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think. the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they dont for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially fred.   well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland. aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she couldnt say a word. and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i dont know what we should do without him. uncle doesnt know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if it would make people understand him. aunts pronunciation is oldfashioned and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we dont and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it.   such delightful times as we are having sightseeing from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures. jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and im cultivating eye and taste as fast as i can. she would like the relics of great people better for ive seen her napoleons cocked hat and gray coat his babys cradle and his old toothbrush also marie antoinettes little shoe the ring of saint denis charlemagnes sword and many other interesting things. ill talk for hours about them when i come but havent time to write.   the palais royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that im nearly distracted because i cant buy them. fred wanted to get me some but of course i didnt allow it. then the bois and champs elysees are tres magnifique. ive seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly hardlooking man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i thoughtpurple dress green hat and yellow gloves. little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his fourhorse barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind.   we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better. pere la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. that is so frenchy.   our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street. it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our days work to go out. fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knewexcept laurie whose manners are more charming. i wish fred was dark for i dont fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i wont find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower.   next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters. i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised. it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.   adieu i embrace you tenderly. votre amie.   heidelberg   my dear mamma   having a quiet hour before we leave for berne ill try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see.   the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might. get fathers old guidebooks and read about it. i havent words beautiful enough to describe it. at coblentz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade. it was a moonlight night and about one oclock flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows. we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below. it was the most romantic thing i ever sawthe river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone.   when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer i suppose. next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental. i laughed at him and said i didnt throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again. im afraid im going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it.   the baths at nassau were very gay so was badenbaden where fred lost some money and i scolded him. he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him. kate said once she hoped hed marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him. frankfurt was delightful. i saw goethes house schillers statue and danneckers famous ariadne. it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better. i didnt like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did. i wish jo would tell me all about it. i ought to have read more for i find i dont know anything and it mortifies me.   now comes the serious part for it happened here and fred has just gone. he has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. i never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. since then ive begun to feel that the moonlight walks balcony talks and daily adventures were something more to him than fun. i havent flirted mother truly but remembered what you said to me and have done my very best. i cant help it if people like me. i dont try to make them and it worries me if i dont care for them though jo says i havent got any heart. now i know mother will shake her head and the girls say oh the mercenary little wretch but ive made up my mind and if fred asks me i shall accept him though im not madly in love. i like him and we get on comfortably together. he is handsome young clever enough and very richever so much richer than the laurences. i dont think his family would object and i should be very happy for they are all kind wellbred generous people and they like me. fred as the eldest twin will have the estate i suppose and such a splendid one it is a city house in a fashionable street not so showy as our big houses but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury such as english people believe in. i like it for its genuine. ive seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses. oh it would be all i should ask and id rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind. i may be mercenary but i hate poverty and dont mean to bear it a minute longer than i can help. one of us must marry well. meg didnt jo wont beth cant yet so i shall and make everything okay all round. i wouldnt marry a man i hated or despised. you may be sure of that and though fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time i should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as i liked. so ive been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that fred liked me. he said nothing but little things showed it. he never goes with flo always gets on my side of the carriage table or promenade looks sentimental when we are alone and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. yesterday at dinner when an austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend a rakishlooking baron about ein wonderschones blondchen fred looked as fierce as a lion and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. he isnt one of the cool stiff englishmen but is rather peppery for he has scotch blood in him as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.   well last evening we went up to the castle about sunset at least all of us but fred who was to meet us there after going to the post restante for letters. we had a charming time poking about the ruins the vaults where the monster tun is and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his english wife. i liked the great terrace best for the view was divine so while the rest went to see the rooms inside i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lions head on the wall with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. i felt as if id got into a romance sitting there watching the neckar rolling through the valley listening to the music of the austrian band below and waiting for my lover like a real storybook girl. i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it. i didnt feel blushy or quakey but quite cool and only a little excited.   byandby i heard freds voice and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me. he looked so troubled that i forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was. he said hed just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill. so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say goodby. i was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook hands and said it in a way that i could not mistake i shall soon come back you wont forget me amy   i didnt promise but i looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and goodbyes for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much. i know he wanted to speak but i think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while for he is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughterinlaw. we shall soon meet in rome and then if i dont change my mind ill say yes thank you when he says will you please   of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on. dont be anxious about me remember i am your prudent amy and be sure i will do nothing rashly. send me as much advice as you like. ill use it if i can. i wish i could see you for a good talk marmee. love and trust me.   ever your amy     chapter thirtytwo tender troubles   jo im anxious about beth.  why mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.  its not her health that troubles me now its her spirits. im sure there is something on her mind and i want you to discover what it is.  what makes you think so mother  she sits alone a good deal and doesnt talk to her father as much as she used. i found her crying over the babies the other day. when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i dont understand. this isnt like beth and it worries me.  have you asked her about it  i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped. i never force my childrens confidence and i seldom have to wait for long.  mrs. march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but beths and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them. why mother beths eighteen but we dont realize it and treat her like a child forgetting shes a woman.  so she is. dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile.  cant be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one. i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you.  its a great comfort jo. i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone. beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready.  why you know i dont mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family. amy is splendid in fine works and im not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once. amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home im your man.  i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to anyone else. be very kind and dont let her think anyone watches or talks about her. if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i shouldnt have a wish in the world.  happy woman ive got heaps.  my dear what are they  ill settle bethys troubles and then ill tell you mine. they are not very wearing so theyll keep. and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her mothers heart at rest about her for the present at least.  while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest. she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together. yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet. sitting at the window beths work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape. suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out all serene coming in tonight.  beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the passerby till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.  hum said jo still intent upon her sisters face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. beth whisked it off and in her halfaverted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill. fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper.  mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made. i never dreamed of such a thing. what will mother say i wonder if her... there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. if he shouldnt love back again how dreadful it would be. he must. ill make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievouslooking boy laughing at her from the wall. oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance. heres meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love. im the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief. jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir youre very charming but youve no more stability than a weathercock. so you neednt write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it wont do a bit of good and i wont have it.  then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion. though laurie flirted with amy and joked with jo his manner to beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was everybodys. therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others. indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of jo who however wouldnt hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. if they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying i told you so. but jo hated philandering and wouldnt allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.  when laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused jo who took great interest in the alternations of hope despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. but there came a time when laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one allabsorbing passion and indulged occasionally in byronic fits of gloom. then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory. this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable.  things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before. if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her. but having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing did not come to the rescue. as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her. but that evening jo fancied that beths eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as sanskrit. she also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in lauries manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little absentminded and settled the afghan over beths feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.  who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room. she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other. i dont see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way.  as everyone was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point.  now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofalong broad wellcushioned and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women. they all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been jos favorite lounging place. among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end. this repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defense a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber.  laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to jo in the sofa corner. if the sausage as they called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it that evening jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofa back both long legs stretched out before him laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction...  now this is filling at the price.  no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow. but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.  come jo dont be thorny. after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.  beth will pet you. im busy.  no shes not to be bothered with me but you like that sort of thing unless youve suddenly lost your taste for it. have you do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him  anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week  not one upon my word. shes engaged. now then.  im glad of it thats one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you dont care two pins continued jo reprovingly.  sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins wont let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings need a vent.  mother doesnt approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately teddy.  id give anything if i could answer so do you. as i cant ill merely say that i dont see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that its only play.  well it does look pleasant but i cant learn how its done. ive tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing but i dont seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor.  take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it.  yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far. i suppose its natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.  im glad you cant flirt. its really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself. between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate im ashamed of them. they dont mean any harm im sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward theyd mend their ways i fancy.  they do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit. if you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them.  much you know about it maam said laurie in a superior tone. we dont like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes. the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman. bless your innocent soul if you could be in my place for a month youd see things that would astonish you a trifle. upon my word when i see one of those harumscarum girls i always want to say with our friend cock robin...  out upon you fie upon you boldfaced jig   it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between lauries chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples. jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls. returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a vent teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones.  you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.  yes i do but youd better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. youre not half good enough forwell whoever the modest girl may be. and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her.  that im not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound jos apron tassel round his finger.  mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me. im dying for some music and always like yours.  id rather stay here thank you.  well you cant there isnt room. go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental. i thought you hated to be tied to a womans apron string retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own.  ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.  are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow.  he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.  jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to beths bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear  i thought you were asleep sobbed beth.  is it the old pain my precious  no its a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears.  tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other.  you cant there is no cure. there beths voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened.  where is it shall i call mother  no no dont call her dont tell her. i shall be better soon. lie down here and poor my head. ill be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will.  jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across beths hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak. but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of beths new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary  yes jo after a long pause.  wouldnt it comfort you to tell me what it is  not now not yet.  then i wont ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can.  i know it. ill tell you byandby.  is the pain better now  oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo.  go to sleep dear. ill stay with you.  so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills.  but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother.  you asked me the other day what my wishes were. ill tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat along together. i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change.  why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning.  with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new. i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am. i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter id like to hop a little way and try my wings.  where will you hop  to new york. i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it. you know mrs. kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew. its rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried.  my dear go out to service in that great boarding house and mrs. march looked surprised but not displeased.  its not exactly going out to service for mrs. kirke is your friendthe kindest soul that ever livedand would make things pleasant for me i know. her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there. dont care if they do. its honest work and im not ashamed of it.  nor i. but your writing  all the better for the change. i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i havent much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish.  i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy  no mother.  may i know the others  jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks. it may be vain and wrong to say it butim afraidlaurie is getting too fond of me.  then you dont care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs. march looked anxious as she put the question.  mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more its out of the question.  im glad of that jo.  why please  because dear i dont think you suited to one another. as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love.  thats just the feeling i had though i couldnt express it. im glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i couldnt fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i  you are sure of his feeling for you  the color deepened in jos cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers im afraid it is so mother. he hasnt said anything but he looks a great deal. i think i had better go away before it comes to anything.  i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go.  jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs. moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope.  ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in allthe desire to see their children happy. meg is so and i am content with her success. you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter. amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her. for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well. by the way she seems brighter this last day or two. have you spoken to her  yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me byandby. i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story.  mrs. march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for lauries sake jo should go away for a time.  let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then ill run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. beth must think im going to please myself as i am for i cant talk about laurie to her. but she can pet and comfort him after im gone and so cure him of this romantic notion. hes been through so many little trials of the sort hes used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity.  jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore.  the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs. kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her. the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit. when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly. he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned.  jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all.  one thing i leave in your especial care she said the night before she left.  you mean your papers asked beth.  no my boy. be very good to him wont you  of course i will but i cant fill your place and hell miss you sadly.  it wont hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order.  ill do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly.  when laurie said goodby he whispered significantly it wont do a bit of good jo. my eye is on you so mind what you do or ill come and bring you home.     chapter thirtythree jos journal   new york november   dear marmee and beth   im going to write you a regular volume for ive got heaps to tell though im not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. when i lost sight of fathers dear old face i felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an irish lady with four small children all crying more or less hadnt diverted my mind for i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.   soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen i cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.   mrs. kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers. she gave me a funny little sky parlorall she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like. a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs and i took a fancy to my den on the spot. the nursery where i am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next mrs. kirkes private parlor and the two little girls are pretty children rather spoiled i fancy but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs and ive no doubt i shall make a model governess.   i am to have my meals with the children if i prefer it to the great table and for the present i do for i am bashful though no one will believe it.   now my dear make yourself at home said mrs. k. in her motherly way im on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if i know the children are safe with you. my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it. there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free. come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can. theres the tea bell i must run and change my cap. and off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.   as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked. the flights are very long in this tall house and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up i saw a gentleman come along behind her take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent it goes better so. the little back is too young to haf such heaviness.   wasnt it good of him i like such things for as father says trifles show character. when i mentioned it to mrs. k. that evening she laughed and said that must have been professor bhaer hes always doing things of that sort.   mrs. k. told me he was from berlin very learned and good but poor as a church mouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an american. not a very romantic story but it interested me and i was glad to hear that mrs. k. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then ill tell you how he looks. hes almost forty so its no harm marmee.   after tea and a gotobed romp with the little girls i attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend. i shall keep a journalletter and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow.   tuesday eve   had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round. some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still. after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind. i was thanking my stars that id learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee. it was dreadfully improper i know but i couldnt resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in. professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him. a regular germanrather stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ones ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble. his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he hadnt a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe. he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend. then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein   i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on.   me wants me bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him.   thou shalt haf thy bhaer. come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him.   now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing. so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr. bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german.   another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door. one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.   both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day.   poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it. he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away. i fancy he has a hard life of it. mrs. kirke asked me if i wouldnt go down to the five oclock dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me. so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs. kirke but as she is short and im tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure. she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me. the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done. there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics. i dont think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her.   cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other. if amy had been here shed have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship. i didnt mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.   as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and i heard one say low to the other whos the new party   governess or something of that sort.   what the deuce is she at our table for   friend of the old ladys.   handsome head but no style.   not a bit of it. give us a light and come on.   i felt angry at first and then i didnt care for a governess is as good as a clerk and ive got sense if i havent style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys. i hate ordinary people   thursday   yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire. i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor. it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. the little thing has lost her heart to mr. bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore. kitty and minnie kirke likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells. the younger men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name. but he enjoys it like a boy mrs. kirke says and takes it so goodnaturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways.   the maiden lady is a miss norton rich cultivated and kind. she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again its such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room. she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it isnt the same sort that amy likes.   i was in our parlor last evening when mr. bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs. kirke. she wasnt there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily. this is mammas friend miss march.   yes and shes jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is an enfant terrible.   we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.   ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch. if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.   i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella. it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other. he didnt seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way...   you haf a fine day to make your walk. bon voyage mademoiselle.   i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty.   saturday   nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if i enjoyed them. she put it as a favor but im sure mrs. kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me. im as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people dont burden me and i accepted gratefully.   when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr. bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jump rope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.   we are playing nargerie explained kitty.   dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the professors hair.   mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come doesnt she mr. bhaer said minnie.   the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly.   i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic i never witnessed. they played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall. i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans dont you   im so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didnt stop me for though ive used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need. pray forward amys as soon as you can spare them. my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know. is teddy studying so hard that he cant find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone. from your faithful jo.   p.s. on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about. bless you   december   my precious betsey   as this is to be a scribblescrabble letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish. they are not so interesting to me as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me. franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence. saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun   we are very good friends now and ive begun to take lessons. i really couldnt help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you. to begin at the beginning mrs. kirke called to me one day as i passed mr. bhaers room where she was rummaging.   did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for ive turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago.   i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure. books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other. halffinished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts. dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room. after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder.   such a man laughed goodnatured mrs. k. as she put the relics in the rag bag. i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails. its dreadful but i cant scold him. hes so absentminded and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.   let me mend them said i. i dont mind it and he neednt know. id like to hes so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books.   so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns. nothing was said and i hoped he wouldnt find it out but one day last week he caught me at it. hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to learn for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear. i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am. the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr. bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him.   so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and this is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german   yes but you are too busy. i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony.   prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense. at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay. and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves. ah but i haf an eye and i see much. i haf a heart and i feel thanks for this. come a little lesson then and now orno more good fairy works for me and mine.   of course i couldnt say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began. i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog. the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then hed look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a tossup with me whether to laugh or cry. i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but didnt blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if id covered myself in glory.   now we shall try a new way. you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble.   he spoke so kindly and opened hans andersons fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a neckornothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely. i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best. when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn. i do him in german gif me your ear. and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear. fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i didnt understand half he read for i couldnt help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical.   after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. i like it very much and he doesnt seem tired of it yet which is very good of him isnt it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money. tell me something nice marmee.   im glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. you see beth manages him better than i did. im not jealous dear do your best only dont make a saint of him. im afraid i couldnt like him without a spice of human naughtiness. read him bits of my letters. i havent time to write much and that will do just as well. thank heaven beth continues so comfortable.   january   a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr. l. and a young man by the name of teddy. i cant tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didnt get it till night and had given up hoping. your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for id had a kind of feeling that you wouldnt forget me. i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy batteredlooking bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced. it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way. the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought. beths new ink bib was capital and hannahs box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. ill be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked. thank you all heaps and heaps   speaking of books reminds me that im getting rich in that line for on new years day mr. bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare. it is one he values much and ive often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer.   you say often you wish a library. here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one. read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.   i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books. i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me. now dont laugh at his horrid name. it isnt pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it. im glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day. mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head. i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer.   not having much money or knowing what hed like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly. they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he neednt burn up what amy calls mouchoirs. i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes. it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all. poor as he is he didnt forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him. i was so glad of that.   they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new years eve. i didnt mean to go down having no dress. but at the last minute mrs. kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers. so i dressed up as mrs. malaprop and sailed in with a mask on. no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile. i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me. i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew id been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters. meg will relish that joke. mr. bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms. to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism.   i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for im cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory. bless you all ever your loving... jo     chapter thirtyfour friend   though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors. the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. she saw that money conferred power money and power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life. the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years jos most cherished castle in the air.  the prizestory experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en espagne. but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouterhearted jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers. like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giants treasures if i remember rightly. but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.  she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even allperfect america read rubbish. she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr. dashwood editor of the weekly volcano. she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment...  excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office. i wished to see mr. dashwood.  down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.  a friend of mine desired me to offera storyjust as an experimentwould like your opinionbe glad to write more if this suits.  while she blushed and blundered mr. dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.  not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a ribbonsure sign of a novice.  no sir. she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner.  oh did she and mr. dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. well you can leave it if you like. weve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but ill run my eye over it and give you an answer next week.  now jo did not like to leave it for mr. dashwood didnt suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture. half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week.  when she went again mr. dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced. mr. dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr. dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.  well take this editors never say i if you dont object to a few alterations. its too long but omitting the passages ive marked will make it just the right length he said in a businesslike tone.  jo hardly knew her own ms. again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her babys legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflectionswhich she had carefully put in as ballast for much romancehad been stricken out.  but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent.  mr. dashwoodss editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could.  people want to be amused not preached at you know. morals dont sell nowadays. which was not quite a correct statement by the way.  you think it would do with these alterations then  yes its a new plot and pretty well worked uplanguage good and so on was mr. dashwoods affable reply.  what do youthat is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself.  oh yes well we give from twentyfive to thirty for things of this sort. pay when it comes out returned mr. dashwood as if that point had escaped him. such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said.  very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the dollaracolumn work even twentyfive seemed good pay.  shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success.  well well look at it. cant promise to take it. tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral. what name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone.  none at all if you please she doesnt wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself.  just as she likes of course. the tale will be out next week. will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr. dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.  ill call. good morning sir.  as she departed mr. dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but shell do.  following mr. dashwoods directions and making mrs. northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.  like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected. her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr. dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch.  she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home. she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward. it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories. mr. dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word.  she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her wellkept secret.  but mr. dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose. jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes. she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons. she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her. she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed. she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a womans character. she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us.  she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other peoples passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge. wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it.  i dont know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections. mr. bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer. jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied hima proceeding which would have much surprised him had he known it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit.  why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first. he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth. he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as happyhearted as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake. jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world. there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others. the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words.  his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer. they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable. his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath. his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full. his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other peoples.  thats it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward ones fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer.  jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him. he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him. he never spoke of himself and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact. from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr. bhaer had never told it. she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor languagemaster in america and his homely hardworking life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it. another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner. miss norton had the entree into most society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor. she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities.  jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all. imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible. the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party.  before the evening was half over jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. mr. bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess. the conversations were miles beyond jos comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over. it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god. jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday.  she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear. he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.  now mr. bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken. as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.  he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truthan eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful. he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he didnt know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man. somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo. the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new. god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact. she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr. bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.  she did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent. she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great.  this belief strengthened daily. she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything. it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off.  its evident he doesnt look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein.  she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. the professor didnt know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .  mees marsch for what do you laugh in your masters face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad  how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo.  lifting his hand to his head the absentminded professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.  ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap. well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him.  but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr. bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house. they are not for children to see nor young people to read. it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm.  jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villain and a viper. she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano. it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her. she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work. now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him. he did not say to himself it is none of my business. ive no right to say anything as many people would have done. he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from mothers love and fathers care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and jos needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely...  yes you are right to put it from you. i do not think that good young girls should see such things. they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash.  all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i dont see any harm in supplying it. many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin.  there is a demand for whisky but i think you and i do not care to sell it. if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest. they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it. no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.  mr. bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands. jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.  i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air.  jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her hardearned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute. then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i wont be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir ill be very good and proper now.  i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.  as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories. being a little shortsighted mr. bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book. now she seemed to have on the professors mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.  they are trash and will soon be worse trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last. ive gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money. i know its so for i cant read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr. bhaer got hold of them  jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.  yes thats the best place for such inflammable nonsense. id better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes.  but when nothing remained of all her three months work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages.  i think i havent done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i hadnt any conscience its so inconvenient. if i didnt care about doing right and didnt feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally. i cant help wishing sometimes that mother and father hadnt been so particular about such things.  ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood.  jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs. sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it. she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr. dashwood that morals didnt sell.  then she tried a childs story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief. but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues. so nothing came of these trials and jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...  i dont know anything. ill wait until i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i cant do better thats honest at least. which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.  while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer. he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing. not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant.  he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life.  it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs. kirke till june. everyone seemed sorry when the time came. the children were inconsolable and mr. bhaers hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.  going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening.  she was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you wont forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you ill never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend.  do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see.  yes come next month. laurie graduates then and youd enjoy commencement as something new.  that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone.  yes my boy teddy. im very proud of him and should like you to see him.  jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. something in mr. bhaers face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew. if it had not been for tina on her knee. she didnt know what would have become of her. fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it. but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially...  i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness. gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away.  but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart. once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find.  it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan. then as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his seldomused meerschaum and opened his plato.  he did his best and did it manfully but i dont think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.  early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the winters gone and ive written no books earned no fortune but ive made a friend worth having and ill try to keep him all my life.     chapter thirtyfive heartache   whatever his motive might have been laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes so his friends said. they were all there his grandfatheroh so proudmr. and mrs. march john and meg jo and beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any aftertriumphs.  ive got to stay for this confounded supper but i shall be home early tomorrow. youll come and meet me as usual girls laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over. he said girls but he meant jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom. she had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly...  ill come teddy rain or shine and march before you playing hail the conquering hero comes on a jewsharp.  laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic oh deary me i know hell say something and then what shall i do  evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she wouldnt be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping teddy wouldnt do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings. a call at megs and a refreshing sniff and sip at the daisy and demijohn still further fortified her for the teteatete but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.  wheres the jewsharp jo cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance.  i forgot it. and jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called loverlike.  she always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove. then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. to rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling jo said hastily now you must have a good long holiday  i intend to.  something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring no teddy. please dont  i will and you must hear me. its no use jo weve got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once.  say what you like then. ill listen said jo with a desperate sort of patience.  laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...  ive loved you ever since ive known you jo couldnt help it youve been so good to me. ive tried to show it but you wouldnt let me. now im going to make you hear and give me an answer for i cant go on so any longer.  i wanted to save you this. i thought youd understand... began jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected.  i know you did but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean. they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact.  i dont. i never wanted to make you care for me so and i went away to keep you from it if i could.  i thought so. it was like you but it was no use. i only loved you all the more and i worked hard to please you and i gave up billiards and everything you didnt like and waited and never complained for i hoped youd love me though im not half good enough... here there was a choke that couldnt be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat.  you you are youre a great deal too good for me and im so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you i dont know why i cant love you as you want me to. ive tried but i cant change the feeling and it would be a lie to say i do when i dont.  really truly jo  he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget.  really truly dear.  they were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from jos lips laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life the fence was too much for him. so he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that jo was frightened.  oh teddy im sorry so desperately sorry i could kill myself if it would do any good i wish you wouldnt take it so hard i cant help it. you know its impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they dont cried jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.  they do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post. i dont believe its the right sort of love and id rather not try it was the decided answer.  there was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind. presently jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile laurie i want to tell you something.  he started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone dont tell me that jo i cant bear it now  tell what she asked wondering at his violence.  that you love that old man.  what old man demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather.  that devilish professor you were always writing about. if you say you love him i know i shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.  jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this dont swear teddy he isnt old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend ive got next to you. pray dont fly into a passion. i want to be kind but i know i shall get angry if you abuse my professor. i havent the least idea of loving him or anybody else.  but you will after a while and then what will become of me  youll love someone else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble.  i cant love anyone else and ill never forget you jo never never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.  what shall i do with him sighed jo finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected. you havent heard what i wanted to tell you. sit down and listen for indeed i want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love.  seeing a ray of hope in that last speech laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face. now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on jos part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him she gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sakehow touching that was to be sure i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to... jo paused a little over the last word but laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.  marryno we shouldnt if you loved me jo i should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like.  no i cant. ive tried and failed and i wont risk our happiness by such a serious experiment. we dont agree and we never shall so well be good friends all our lives but we wont go and do anything rash.  yes we will if we get the chance muttered laurie rebelliously.  now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored jo almost at her wits end.  i wont be reasonable. i dont want to take what you call a sensible view. it wont help me and it only makes it harder. i dont believe youve got any heart.  i wish i hadnt.  there was a little quiver in jos voice and thinking it a good omen laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before dont disappoint us dear everyone expects it. grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i cant get on without you. say you will and lets be happy. do do  not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could. it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.  i cant say yes truly so i wont say it at all. youll see that im right byandby and thank me for it... she began solemnly.  ill be hanged if i do and laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the very idea.  yes you will persisted jo. youll get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house. i shouldnt. im homely and awkward and odd and old and youd be ashamed of me and we should quarrelwe cant help it even now you seeand i shouldnt like elegant society and you would and youd hate my scribbling and i couldnt get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we hadnt done it and everything would be horrid  anything more asked laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst.  nothing more except that i dont believe i shall ever marry. im happy as i am and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man.  i know better broke in laurie. you think so now but therell come a time when you will care for somebody and youll love him tremendously and live and die for him. i know you will its your way and i shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragic.  yes i will live and die for him if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried jo losing patience with poor teddy. ive done my best but you wont be reasonable and its selfish of you to keep teasing for what i cant give. i shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but ill never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of usso now  that speech was like gunpowder. laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone youll be sorry some day jo.  oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her.  to the devil was the consoling answer.  for a minute jos heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in any race. jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.  that will do him good and hell come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that i shant dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves. now i must go and prepare mr. laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. i wish hed love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her. oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them i think its dreadful.  being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to mr. laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach. he found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harms way for young impetuositys parting words to jo disturbed him more than he would confess.  when laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two. but when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last years success which to him now seemed like loves labor lost. he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play. the windows were open and jo walking in the garden with beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the sonata pathetique and played it as he never did before.  thats very fine i dare say but its sad enough to make one cry. give us something gayer lad said mr. laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how.  laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull mrs. marchs voice had not been heard calling jo dear come in. i want you.  just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning as he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark.  i cant stand this muttered the old gentleman. up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman i know my boy i know.  no answer for an instant then laurie asked sharply who told you  jo herself.  then theres an end of it and he shook off his grandfathers hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his mans pride could not bear a mans pity.  not quite. i want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned mr. laurence with unusual mildness. you wont care to stay at home now perhaps  i dont intend to run away from a girl. jo cant prevent my seeing her and i shall stay and do it as long as i like interrupted laurie in a defiant tone.  not if you are the gentleman i think you. im disappointed but the girl cant help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time. where will you go  anywhere. i dont care what becomes of me and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfathers ear.  take it like a man and dont do anything rash for gods sake. why not go abroad as you planned and forget it  i cant.  but youve been wild to go and i promised you should when you got through college.  ah but i didnt mean to go alone and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.  i dont ask you to go alone. theres someone ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world.  who sir stopping to listen.  myself.  laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily im a selfish brute butyou knowgrandfather  lord help me yes i do know for ive been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father. now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan. its all settled and can be carried out at once said mr. laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him.  well sir what is it and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice.  there is business in london that needs looking after. i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them. my partners do almost everything im merely holding on until you take my place and can be off at any time.  but you hate traveling sir. i cant ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all.  the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul im not superannuated yet. i quite enjoy the idea. it will do me good and my old bones wont suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair.  a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i dont mean to be a marplot or a burden. i go because i think youd feel happier than if i was left behind. i dont intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way. ive friends in london and paris and should like to visit them. meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your hearts content.  now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir. it doesnt matter where i go or what i do.  it does to me remember that my lad. i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it. promise me that laurie.  anything you like sir.  good thought the old gentleman. you dont care now but therell come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or im much mistaken.  being an energetic individual mr. laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off. during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs. march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy. of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.  when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. this gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs. march kissed him with a whisper full of motherly solicitude. then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life. jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.  oh jo cant you  teddy dear i wish i could  that was all except a little pause. then laurie straightened himself up said its all right never mind and went away without another word. ah but it wasnt all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again.     chapter thirtysix beths secret   when jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in beth. no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on jos heart as she saw her sisters face. it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo for a time forgot her fear.  but when laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her. she had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home. another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies jo took beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.  it was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another. beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else. so they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away.  they did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome. jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and beths but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak. she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better. she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in jos lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.  one day beth told her. jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on beths cheeks. but she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting. it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away from her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say jo dear im glad you know it. ive tried to tell you but i couldnt.  there was no answer except her sisters cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry. she was the weaker then and beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.  ive known it for a good while dear and now im used to it it isnt hard to think of or to bear. try to see it so and dont be troubled about me because its best indeed it is.  is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn beth you did not feel it then and keep it to yourself so long did you asked jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that laurie had no part in beths trouble.  yes i gave up hoping then but i didnt like to own it. i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone. but when i saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that i could never be like you and then i was miserable jo.  oh beth and you didnt tell me didnt let me comfort and help you how could you shut me out bear it all alone  jos voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodbye to health love and life and take up her cross so cheerfully.  perhaps it was wrong but i tried to do right. i wasnt sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken. it would have been selfish to frighten you all when marmee was so anxious about meg and amy away and you so happy with laurieat least i thought so then.  and i thought you loved him beth and i went away because i couldnt cried jo glad to say all the truth.  beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you didnt dearie i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.  why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child. i do love him dearly. he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother. i hope he truly will be sometime.  not through me said jo decidedly. amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now. i dont care what becomes of anybody but you beth. you must get well.  i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back. its like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it cant be stopped.  it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth. i cant let you go. ill work and pray and fight against it. ill keep you in spite of everything. there must be ways it cant be too late. god wont be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than beths.  simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations. beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death. like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself. she could not say im glad to go for life was very sweet for her. she could only sob out i try to be willing while she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together.  by and by beth said with recovered serenity youll tell them this when we go home  i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day.  perhaps not. ive heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things. if they dont see it you will tell them for me. i dont want any secrets and its kinder to prepare them. meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother wont you jo  if i can. but beth i dont give up yet. im going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think its true. said jo trying to speak cheerfully.  beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i dont know how to express myself and shouldnt try to anyone but you because i cant speak out except to my jo. i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long. im not like the rest of you. i never made any plans about what id do when i grew up. i never thought of being married as you all did. i couldnt seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there. i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all. im not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven.  jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. a whitewinged gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast. beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness. a little graycoated sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea. it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home. beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.  dear little bird see jo how tame it is. i like peeps better than the gulls. they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things. i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of mebusy quakercolored creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs. you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone. meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she writes about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again. dear little girl shes so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home. i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away.  she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her. im going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth.  jo dear dont hope any more. it wont do any good. im sure of that. we wont be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait. well have happy times for i dont suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me.  jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth.  she was right. there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing. tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling beths secret. her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word.     chapter thirtyseven new impressions   at three oclock in the afternoon all the fashionable world at nice may be seen on the promenade des anglaisa charming place for the wide walk bordered with palms flowers and tropical shrubs is bounded on one side by the sea on the other by the grand drive lined with hotels and villas while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills. many nations are represented many languages spoken many costumes worn and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. haughty english lively french sober germans handsome spaniards ugly russians meek jews freeandeasy americans all drive sit or saunter here chatting over the news and criticizing the latest celebrity who has arrivedristori or dickens victor emmanuel or the queen of the sandwich islands. the equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind.  along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. he looked like an italian was dressed like an englishman and had the independent air of an americana combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with rosecolored neckties buff gloves and orange flowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches. there were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue. presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the jardin publique or to wander along the beach toward castle hill. the quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single young lady came rapidly down the street. the lady was young blonde and dressed in blue. he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her.  oh laurie is it really you i thought youd never come cried amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a french mamma who hastened her daughters steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad english.  i was detained by the way but i promised to spend christmas with you and here i am.  how is your grandfather when did you come where are you staying  very welllast nightat the chauvain. i called at your hotel but you were out.  i have so much to say i dont know where to begin get in and we can talk at our ease. i was going for a drive and longing for company. flos saving up for tonight.  what happens then a ball  a christmas party at our hotel. there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day. youll go with us of course aunt will be charmed.  thank you. where now asked laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited amy who preferred to drive for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction.  im going to the bankers first for letters and then to castle hill. the view is so lovely and i like to feed the peacocks. have you ever been there  often years ago but i dont mind having a look at it.  now tell me all about yourself. the last i heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from berlin.  yes i spent a month there and then joined him in paris where he has settled for the winter. he has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so i go and come and we get on capitally.  thats a sociable arrangement said amy missing something in lauries manner though she couldnt tell what.  why you see he hates to travel and i hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble. i am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while i like to feel that someone is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings. dirty old hole isnt it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the place napoleon in the old city.  the dirt is picturesque so i dont mind. the river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight. now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass. its going to the church of st. john.  while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies whiteveiled nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the merryfaced boy she left in the moodylooking man beside her. he was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and spiritlessnot sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him. she couldnt understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.  que pensezvous she said airing her french which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad.  that mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look.  she blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and told her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head. she didnt like the new tone for though not blase it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.  if thats the way hes going to grow up i wish hed stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.  at avigdors she found the precious home letters and giving the reins to laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in june.  beth is very poorly mother says. i often think i ought to go home but they all say stay. so i do for i shall never have another chance like this said amy looking sober over one page.  i think you are right there. you could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear.  he drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on amys heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land. presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribbling suit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words genius burns.  laurie smiled took it put it in his vest pocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter amy read him.  this will be a regularly merry christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed. while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought. he found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance. always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish.  laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a brightfaced girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.  as they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there do you remember the cathedral and the corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to villa franca schuberts tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say is corsica  i remember. its not much changed he answered without enthusiasm.  what jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.  yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even napoleon now made interesting in his sight.  take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said amy seating herself ready for a good talk.  but she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the continent and been to greece. so after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to mrs. carrol laurie left them promising to return in the evening.  it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night. time and absence had done its work on both the young people. she had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight. amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman.  tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective. it must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies. but dear heart we all have our little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.  i do want him to think i look well and tell them so at home said amy to herself as she put on flos old white silk ball dress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a hebelike knot at the back of her head.  its not the fashion but its becoming and i cant afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded.  having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines. remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chasseed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.  my new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on aunts mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. if i only had a classical nose and mouth i should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.  in spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away. she seldom ranit did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. she walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. it so happened that she could not have done a better thing for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a wellplaced statue.  good evening diana said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.  good evening apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonair and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart.  here are your flowers. i arranged them myself remembering that you didnt like what hannah calls a sotbookay said laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in cardiglias window.  how kind you are she exclaimed gratefully. if id known you were coming id have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this im afraid.  thank you. it isnt what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.  please dont.  i thought you liked that sort of thing.  not from you it doesnt sound natural and i like your old bluntness better.  im glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home.  the company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent. the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their christmas ball.  a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like hamlets mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour. baron rothschilds private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his masters name crowned him with a golden halo. a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight. of course there were many lightfooted shrillvoiced american girls handsome lifelesslooking english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters.  any young girl can imagine amys state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on lauries arm. she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood. she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguishedlooking friend might be. with the first burst of the band amys color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it. therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance  one usually does at a ball.  her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible.  i meant the first dance. may i have the honor  i can give you one if i put off the count. he dances divinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with.  nice little boy but rather a short pole to support...  a daughter of the gods devinely tall and most divinely fair   was all the satisfaction she got however.  the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish. laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. she showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa. but his polite regrets didnt impose upon her and when she galloped away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.  that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moments rest. her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. lauries eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be. he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman.  it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light. the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who couldnt admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. the air was dark with davises and many joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes. the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train. the serene teuton found the suppertable and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed. but the emperors friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an indiarubber ball. he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a french pickwick without glasses.  amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.  it had been successful for at threeandtwenty blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion. laurie had a wakedup look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good  you look like balzacs femme peinte par ellememe he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.  my rouge wont come off. and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright.  what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee.  illusion.  good name for it. its very prettynew thing isnt it  its as old as the hills. you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till nowstupide  i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see.  none of that it is forbidden. id rather take coffee than compliments just now. no dont lounge it makes me nervous.  laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection.  where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look.  as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.  wellthe general air the style the selfpossession thetheillusionyou know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.  amy was gratified but of course didnt show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of ones self. i study as well as play and as for thiswith a little gesture toward her dresswhy tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things.  amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it wasnt in good taste but laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly nor why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.     chapter thirtyeight on the shelf   in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la liberte becomes their motto. in america as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet. whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day im as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because im married.  not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever.  as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else. day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department. being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored. but three months passed and there was no return of repose. meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons. when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day. if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies. if he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decidedleave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night. his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him halfhelped if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above. and when he read his paper of an evening demis colic got into the shipping list and daisys fall affected the price of stocks for mrs. brooke was only interested in domestic news.  the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland. he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles dotried to get a little comfort elsewhere. scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. mrs. scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully. the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.  john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbors society.  meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children. but byandby when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender. she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain. she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them. want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.  yes she would say looking in the glass im getting old and ugly. john doesnt find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances. well the babies love me they dont care if i am thin and pale and havent time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what ive gladly sacrificed for them wont he my precious  to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being. but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him. not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for megs drooping spirits had not escaped her observation.  i wouldnt tell anyone except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs. brooke drying her tears on daisys bib with an injured air.  goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously.  hes away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts. it isnt fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement. men are very selfish even the best of them.  so are women. dont blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself.  but it cant be right for him to neglect me.  dont you neglect him  why mother i thought youd take my part  so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg.  i dont see how.  let me show you. did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time  no but i cant do it now with two babies to tend.  i think you could dear and i think you ought. may i speak quite freely and will you remember that its mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes  indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again. i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything.  meg drew her low chair beside her mothers and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever.  you have only made the mistake that most young wives makeforgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children. a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them. ive seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time.  im afraid it wont. if i ask him to stay hell think im jealous and i wouldnt insult him by such an idea. he doesnt see that i want him and i dont know how to tell him without words.  make it so pleasant he wont want to go away. my dear hes longing for his little home but it isnt home without you and you are always in the nursery.  oughtnt i to be there  not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything. besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies. dont neglect husband for children dont shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it. his place is there as well as yours and the children need him. let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all.  you really think so mother  i know it meg for ive tried it and i seldom give advice unless ive proved its practicability. when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i didnt do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you. poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone. i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me. i nearly spoiled her by indulgence. you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself. then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to get on without him since. that is the secret of our home happiness. he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always.  it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours. show me how ill do anything you say.  you always were my docile daughter. well dear if i were you id let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and its none too soon to begin. then id do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you. she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again. go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the sunshinemaker of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. then id try to take an interest in whatever john likestalk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way. dont shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the worlds work for it all affects you and yours.  john is so sensible im afraid he will think im stupid if i ask questions about politics and things.  i dont believe he would. love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he doesnt find your society far more agreeable than mrs. scotts suppers.  i will. poor john im afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything.  he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy. this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it. and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train. dont let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should. now dear goodby. think over mothers preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all.  meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted. mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. for demi inherited a trifle of his sires firmness of character we wont call it obstinacy and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything all the kings horses and all the kings men could not change that pertinacious little mind. mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience. so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all mammas love pats.  a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment. but unfortunately demis most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage. so poor meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every sleepprevoking wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes wouldnt shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly wideawake expression of countenance.  will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the hall door softly closed and the wellknown step went tiptoeing into the dining room.  me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel.  no but ill save you some little cakies for breakfast if youll go byebye like daisy. will you lovey  iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day.  taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight. do you expect company  only you dear.  is it a birthday anniversary or anything  no im tired of being dowdy so i dressed up as a change. you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why shouldnt i when i have the time  i do it out of respect for you my dear said oldfashioned john.  ditto ditto mr. brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot.  well its altogether delightful and like old times. this tastes right. i drink your health dear. and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently...  opy doy. mes tummin  its that naughty boy. i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death acold pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call.  mornin now announced demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances.  no it isnt morning yet. you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma. then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.  me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. but john shook his head and said to meg...  if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you.  yes of course. come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery.  nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning.  iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.  meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar.  now this wont do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner. we shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly. you have made a slave of yourself long enough. give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it. put him in his bed and leave him meg.  he wont stay there he never does unless i sit by him.  ill manage him. demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you.  sant replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.  you must never say that to papa. i shall carry you if you dont go yourself.  go way me dont love parpar. and demi retired to his mothers skirts for protection.  but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand. bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs. the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young mans strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf. no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear. this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to megs heart and she ran up to say beseechingly...  let me stay with him hell be good now john.  no my dear. ive told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night.  but hell cry himself sick pleaded meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy.  no he wont hes so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind. dont interfere ill manage him.  hes my child and i cant have his spirit broken by harshness.  hes my child and i wont have his temper spoiled by indulgence. go down my dear and leave the boy to me.  when john spoke in that masterful tone meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility.  please let me kiss him once john  certainly. demi say good night to mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.  meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.  poor little man hes worn out with sleep and crying. ill cover him up and then go and set megs heart at rest thought john creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.  but he wasnt for the moment his father peeped at him demis eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough mes dood now.  sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his fathers arm and holding his fathers finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby. so held john had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole days work.  as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies. he does know how to manage them and will be a great help for demi is getting too much for me.  when john came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired. john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that meg was such a transparent little person she couldnt keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clue would soon appear. he read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet. in her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when john paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity well i really dont see what we are coming to.  john laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.  she is trying to like politics for my sake so ill try and like millinery for hers thats only fair thought john the just adding aloud thats very pretty. is it what you call a breakfast cap  my dear man its a bonnet my very best gotoconcertandtheater bonnet.  i beg your pardon it was so small i naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear. how do you keep it on  these bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.  its a love of a bonnet but i prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and john kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.  im glad you like it for i want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night. i really need some music to put me in tune. will you please  of course i will with all my heart or anywhere else you like. you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things. what put it into your head little mother  well i had a talk with marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt and she said i needed change and less care so hannah is to help me with the children and im to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety brokendown old woman before my time. its only an experiment john and i want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because ive neglected you shamefully lately and im going to make home what it used to be if i can. you dont object i hope  never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin. all that we have any business to know is that john did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates. it was not all paradise by any means but everyone was better for the division of labor system. the children throve under the paternal rule for accurate steadfast john brought order and obedience into babydom while meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband. home grew homelike again and john had no wish to leave it unless he took meg with him. the scotts came to the brookes now and everyone found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love. even sallie moffatt liked to go there. it is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid loneliness for there were no riotous sunnyfaced babies there and ned lived in a world of his own where there was no place for her.  this household happiness did not come all at once but john and meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy. this is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old saxon word the houseband and learning as meg learned that a womans happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.     chapter thirtynine lazy laurence   laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month. he was tired of wandering about alone and amys familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part. he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home. amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess. they naturally took comfort in each others society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season. but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were halfconsciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other. amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm. laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him. it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such halfsorrowful halfscornful surprise.  all the rest have gone to monaco for the day. i preferred to stay at home and write letters. they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon.  well yes but isnt it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.  im going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so youll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie.  then ill go with pleasure. and he put out his hand for her sketchbook. but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...  dont trouble yourself. its no exertion to me but you dont look equal to it.  laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch.  the two never quarreled. amy was too wellbred and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air. she answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner.  it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beautyloving eyes. here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. there a barelegged shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. meek mousecolored donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went. brown softeyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough. gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky.  valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passersby and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty. roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace whence one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the whitewalled city on its shore.  this is a regular honeymoon paradise isnt it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.  no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach.  try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny creamcolored ones that starred the wall behind her. she put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of halfsweet halfbitter melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere. he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home. the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came.  its good advice youd better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him.  thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest.  laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat.  very soon.  you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.  i dare say short answers save trouble.  he expects you and you really ought to go.  hospitable creature i know it.  then why dont you do it  natural depravity i suppose.  natural indolence you mean. its really dreadful and amy looked severe.  not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.  amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again.  what are you doing just now  watching lizards.  no no. i mean what do you intend and wish to do  smoke a cigarette if youll allow me.  how provoking you are i dont approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch. i need a figure.  with all the pleasure in life. how will you have me full length or threequarters on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente.  stay as you are and go to sleep if you like. i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone.  what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction.  what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sisters name.  as usual go away teddy. im busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet. both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on lauries facea hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret. it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again. she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.  you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the wellcut profile defined against the dark stone.  wish i was  thats a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life. you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a halftimid halfwistful look more significant than her unfinished speech.  laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother its all right maam.  that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately. it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said...  im glad of that i didnt think youd been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked badenbaden lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour. dont stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets.  laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of amys hat that lay there.  im all ready for the secrets. and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes.  ive none to tell. you may begin.  havent one to bless myself with. i thought perhaps youd had some news from home..  you have heard all that has come lately. dont you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes.  shes very busy. im roving about so its impossible to be regular you know. when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.  never she answered with a despondent but decided air. rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.  why should you with so much energy and talent  thats just why because talent isnt genius and no amount of energy can make it so. i want to be great or nothing. i wont be a commonplace dauber so i dont intend to try any more.  and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask  polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance.  it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and amys ambition had a good foundation. laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a longcherished one died and spent no time lamenting.  good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy.  amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now im going to play brother and ask questions. may i  i dont promise to answer.  your face will if your tongue wont. you arent woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear. i heard rumors about fred and you last year and its my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey  thats not for me to say was amys grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.  you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very elderbrotherly and grave all of a sudden.  no.  but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees wont you  very likely.  then you are fond of old fred  i could be if i tried.  but you dont intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence hes a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied youd like.  he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.  i understand. queens of society cant get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mothers girls.  true nevertheless.  a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker. laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain. his look and silence as well as a certain inward selfdisapproval ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.  i wish youd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply.  do it for me theres a dear girl.  i could if i tried. and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style.  try then. i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.  youd be angry in five minutes.  im never angry with you. it takes two flints to make a fire. you are as cool and soft as snow.  you dont know what i can do. snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly. your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it.  stir away it wont hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him. regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you.  being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began.  flo and i have got a new name for you. its lazy laurence. how do you like it  she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable thats not bad. thank you ladies.  do you want to know what i honestly think of you  pining to be told.  well i despise you.  if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly...  why if you please  because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable.  strong language mademoiselle.  if you like it ill go on.  pray do its quite interesting.  i thought youd find it so. selfish people always like to talk about themselves.  am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.  yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one. ill show you how for ive studied you while we were frolicking and im not at all satisfied with you. here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends.  isnt a fellow to have any pleasure after a fouryear grind  you dont look as if youd had much. at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see. i said when we first met that you had improved. now i take it all back for i dont think you half so nice as when i left you at home. you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones. with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity but its the truth so i cant help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only... there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it.  saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence. but the lecture began to take effect for there was a wideawake sparkle in his eyes now and a halfangry halfinjured expression replaced the former indifference.  i supposed youd take it so. you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and wont listen which proves how much your flattery is worth. amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet.  in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and lauries voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good  but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly arent you ashamed of a hand like that its as soft and white as a womans and looks as if it never did anything but wear jouvins best gloves and pick flowers for ladies. you are not a dandy thank heaven so im glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago. dear soul i wish she was here to help me  so do i  the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy. she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth. she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in amys mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her. she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it. her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.  i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you werent the sweetesttempered fellow in the world youd be very angry with me. but we are all so fond and proud of you i couldnt bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do.  i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one.  they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever. i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time.  hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.  i beg pardon i thought... and there she paused diplomatically.  no you didnt you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke.  i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken. and jo wouldnt be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly.  she was kind but not in the right way and its lucky for her she didnt love me if im the goodfornothing fellow you think me. its her fault though and you may tell her so.  the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply.  i was wrong i didnt know. im very sorry i was so cross but i cant help wishing youd bear it better teddy dear.  dont thats her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in jos halfkind halfreproachful tone. wait till youve tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful.  id take it manfully and be respected if i couldnt be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.  now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone. amys lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference. he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again. presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do  yes if she saw you now. she hates lazy people. why dont you do something splendid and make her love you  i did my best but it was no use.  graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your grandfathers sake. it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well.  i did fail say what you will for jo wouldnt love me began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.  no you didnt and youll say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried. if youd only set about another task of some sort youd soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble.  thats impossible.  try it and see. you neednt shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things. i dont pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than youd imagine. im interested in other peoples experiences and inconsistencies and though i cant explain i remember and use them for my own benefit. love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want. there i wont lecture any more for i know youll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.  neither spoke for several minutes. laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked. presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that  he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face halfshut eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamers head.  how well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a halflaugh yes thats me.  as you are. this is as you were. and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held.  it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young mans face as he looked. only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse. hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. in the ruffled mane the riders breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch. laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way...  dont you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you. i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you.  much obliged. youve improved immensely since then and i congratulate you. may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five oclock is the dinner hour at your hotel  laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess. amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself...  now ive offended him. well if it does him good im glad if it makes him hate me im sorry but its true and i cant take back a word of it.  they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptiste up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits. but both felt ill at ease. the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.  shall we see you this evening mon frere asked amy as they parted at her aunts door.  unfortunately i have an engagement. au revoir madamoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men. something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly...  no be yourself with me laurie and part in the good old way. id rather have a hearty english handshake than all the sentimental salutations in france.  goodbye dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.  next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.  my dear mentor please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for lazy laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys. a pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa i think fred would be benefited by a rouser. tell him so with my congratulations.   yours gratefully telemachus   good boy im glad hes gone said amy with an approving smile. the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh yes i am glad but how i shall miss him.     chapter forty the valley of the shadow   when the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble. they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.  the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth and in it was gathered everything that she most loved flowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies. fathers best books found their way there mothers easy chair jos desk amys finest sketches and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for aunty beth. john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.  here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind. the feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for pictureloving eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. if beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude.  the first few months were very happy ones and beth often used to look round and say how beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible. simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the fathers heart was in the ministers religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read.  it was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for byandby beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever. talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh. ah me such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry help me help me and to feel that there was no help. a sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. with the wreck of her frail body beths soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the shining ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river.  jo never left her for an hour since beth had said i feel stronger when you are here. she slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble. all day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her. precious and helpful hours to jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed. lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly.  often when she woke jo found beth reading in her wellworn little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well.  seeing this did more for jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter. for with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her sisters lifeuneventful unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the selfforgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all.  one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite pilgrimss progress she found a little paper scribbled over in jos hand. the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it.  poor jo shes fast asleep so i wont wake her to ask leave. she shows me all her things and i dont think shell mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.  my beth   sitting patient in the shadow till the blessed light shall come a serene and saintly presence sanctifies our troubled home. earthly joys and hopes and sorrows break like ripples on the strand of the deep and solemn river where her willing feet now stand.   o my sister passing from me out of human care and strife leave me as a gift those virtues which have beautified your life. dear bequeath me that great patience which has power to sustain a cheerful uncomplaining spirit in its prisonhouse of pain.   give me for i need it sorely of that courage wise and sweet which has made the path of duty green beneath your willing feet. give me that unselfish nature that with charity divine can pardon wrong for loves dear sake meek heart forgive me mine   thus our parting daily loseth something of its bitter pain and while learning this hard lesson my great loss becomes my gain. for the touch of grief will render my wild nature more serene give to life new aspirations a new trust in the unseen.   henceforth safe across the river i shall see forever more a beloved household spirit waiting for me on the shore. hope and faith born of my sorrow guardian angels shall become and the sister gone before me by their hands shall lead me home.   blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to beths face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared. as she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder. jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping beth slept.  not asleep but so happy dear. see i found this and read it. i knew you wouldnt care. have i been all that to you jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness.  oh beth so much so much and jos head went down upon the pillow beside her sisters.  then i dont feel as if id wasted my life. im not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right. and now when its too late to begin even to do better its such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much and feels as if id helped them.  more than any one in the world beth. i used to think i couldnt let you go but im learning to feel that i dont lose you that youll be more to me than ever and death cant part us though it seems to.  i know it cannot and i dont fear it any longer for im sure i shall be your beth still to love and help you more than ever. you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when im gone. they will turn to you dont fail them and if its hard to work alone remember that i dont forget you and that youll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the end so easy.  ill try beth. and then and there jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love.  so the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fairly early and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as father and mother guided her tenderly through the valley of the shadow and gave her up to god.  seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep. as beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh.  with tears and prayers and tender hands mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread.  when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out jos place was empty and the room was very still. but a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked god that beth was well at last.     chapter fortyone learning to forget   amys lecture did laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward. men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation dont take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do. then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it. if it fails they generously give her the whole. laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again. there was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received. pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impressioni despise you. go and do something splendid that will make her love you.  laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down. he felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. jo wouldnt love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girls no had not spoiled his life. he had always meant to do something and amys advice was quite unnecessary. he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred. that being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on.  as goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music and to compose a requiem which should harrow up jos soul and melt the heart of every hearer. therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself. but whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the requiem was beyond him just at present. it was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the christmas ball at nice especially the stout frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.  then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him. he wanted jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love. but memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall jos oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental aspectsbeating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna barricading herself with the sofa pillow or throwing cold water over his passion a la gummidgeand an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. jo wouldnt be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer.  when he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness. this phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his minds eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons. he did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.  thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter. he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. its genius simmering perhaps. ill let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasnt genius but something far more common. whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer. returning from one of mozarts grand operas splendidly performed at the royal theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring at the busts of mendelssohn beethoven and bach who stared benignly back again. then suddenly he tore up his music sheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself...  she is right talent isnt genius and you cant make it so. that music has taken the vanity out of me as rome took it out of her and i wont be a humbug any longer. now what shall i do  that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread. now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say alls well kept him safe and steady.  very likely some mrs. grundy will observe i dont believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles. i dare say you dont mrs. grundy but its true nevertheless. women work a good many miracles and i have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must. but mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good womens eyes. if it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it.  laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day. he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and couldnt understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us. lauries heart wouldnt ache. the wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember. he had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it. he was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon. he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze. there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.  as the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of his reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him...  well he was a great man and when he couldnt have one sister he took the other and was happy.  laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself no i wont i havent forgotten i never can. ill try again and if that fails why then...  leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind. couldnt she wouldnt sheand let him come home and be happy while waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience. it came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for jo decidedly couldnt and wouldnt. she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again. then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister jo. in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay. that would be time enough please god but laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious.  so i will at once. poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her im afraid and laurie opened his desk as if writing to amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before.  but he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose. tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of jos letters and in another compartment were three notes from amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside. with a halfrepentant halfamused expression laurie gathered up all jos letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear high mass at saint stefans feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.  the letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner. the correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring. laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to paris hoping somebody would arrive before long. he wanted desperately to go to nice but would not till he was asked and amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of our boy.  fred vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer yes thank you but now she said no thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. the words fred is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and lauries face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money. it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly. she didnt want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature. she didnt care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman. she was so glad he didnt hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever. his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come. it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted. she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him. it couldnt be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them. but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother.  if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are. amy never lectured now. she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things. but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal. she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory.  her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt. that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air...  i was sure she would think better of it. poor old fellow ive been through it all and i can sympathize.  with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed amys letter luxuriously.  while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home. but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister. the sad news met her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes. she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow. but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her.  he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him. the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense.  he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension. the garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden. if monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her. but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.  a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her. she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come. she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden. he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of amys character. everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament. if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing...  oh laurie laurie i knew youd come to me  i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill jos place and make him happy. he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence.  in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry wellworn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting.  i couldnt help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you. it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you wouldnt come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally.  i came the minute i heard. i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and... he could not get any further for he too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say. he longed to lay amys head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words.  you neednt say anything this comforts me she said softly. beth is well and happy and i mustnt wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all. we wont talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay. you neednt go right back need you  not if you want me dear.  i do so much. aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while.  amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she wantedthe petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed.  poor little soul you look as if youd grieved yourself half sick im going to take care of you so dont cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the halfcaressing halfcommanding way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the newleaved chestnuts. he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone.  the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below. for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.  the moment mrs. carrol saw the girls altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it allthe child has been pining for young laurence. bless my heart i never thought of such a thing  with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude. amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success.  at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded. at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.  the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills. the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists. the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts. the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another.  in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love. he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that jos sister was almost the same as jos self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well. his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret. he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the bittersweet experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible. there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo. but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.  he had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorous manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st. gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st. bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like whitewinged gulls.  they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his heloise. neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something...  you must be tired. rest a little and let me row. it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious.  im not tired but you may take an oar if you like. theres room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat wont trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangement.  feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar. she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water.  how well we pull together dont we said amy who objected to silence just then.  so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat. will you amy very tenderly.  yes laurie very low.  then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake.     chapter fortytwo all alone   it was easy to promise selfabnegation when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example. but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but loneliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep. how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow. it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work.  poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. i cant do it. i wasnt meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesnt come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.  but someone did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow oh beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain. for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sisters faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than jos and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went handinhand with natural sorrow. sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthened love. feeling this jos burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her mothers arms.  when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth. i need it more than she did for im all wrong.  my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it.  then sitting in beths little chair close beside him jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act. for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit. for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.  other helps had johumble wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value. brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away. as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating beths orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she didnt know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...  you thoughtful creeter youre determined we shant miss that dear lamb ef you can help it. we dont say much but we see it and the lord will bless you fort see ef he dont.  as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other.  marriage is an excellent thing after all. i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it always perwisin i could said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the topsyturvy nursery.  its just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature jo. you are like a chestnut burr prickly outside but silkysoft within and a sweet kernal if one can only get at it. love will make you show your heart one day and then the rough burr will fall off.  frost opens chestnut burrs maam and it takes a good shake to bring them down. boys go nutting and i dont care to be bagged by them returned jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for daisy had tied herself on as a bob.  meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of jos old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of megs most effective arguments were the babies whom jo loved tenderly. grief is the best opener of some hearts and jos was nearly ready for the bag. a little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a boys impatient shake but a mans hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernal sound and sweet. if she suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she wasnt thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped.  now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket. but you see jo wasnt a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested. its highly virtuous to say well be good but we cant do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing she had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her and if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others  providence had taken her at her word. here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it. now could she do it she decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested. still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called difficulty.  why dont you write that always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit overshadowed jo.  ive no heart to write and if i had nobody cares for my things.  we do. write something for us and never mind the rest of the world. try it dear. im sure it would do you good and please us very much.  dont believe i can. but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her halffinished manuscripts.  an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused mrs. march to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion. jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested. letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it. for a small thing it was a great success and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.  i dont understand it. what can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered.  there is truth in it jo thats the secret. humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last. you wrote with no thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter. you have had the bitter now comes the sweet. do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success.  if there is anything good or true in what i write it isnt mine. i owe it all to you and mother and beth said jo more touched by her fathers words than by any amount of praise from the world.  so taught by love and sorrow jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.  when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs. march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for though jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice. it was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make.  you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another.  yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred. i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day.  how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a word to me.  mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage. i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.  im not the scatterbrain i was. you may trust me. im sober and sensible enough for anyones confidante now.  so you are my dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved someone else.  now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after id refused his love when it was freshest if not best  i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer. forgive me dear i cant help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.  no mother it is better as it is and im glad amy has learned to love him. but you are right in one thing. i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away.  im glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on. there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward.  mothers are the best lovers in the world but i dont mind whispering to marmee that id like to try all kinds. its very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want. id no idea hearts could take in so many. mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family. i dont understand it.  i do and mrs. march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie.  it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me. he isnt sentimental doesnt say much about it but i see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that i dont seem to be the same girl i was. i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know its mine. he says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast. i pray he may and try to be all he believes me for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while god lets us be together. oh mother i never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another  and thats our cool reserved and worldly amy truly love does work miracles. how very very happy they must be and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again.  byandby jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk. a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing. it was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and amys happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to love with heart and soul and cling to while god let them be together. up in the garret where jos unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye. she drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind mrs. kirkes. she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the professors hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart.  wait for me my friend. i may be a little late but i shall surely come.  oh if he only would so kind so good so patient with me always my dear old fritz. i didnt value him half enough when i had him but now how i should love to see him for everyone seems going away from me and im all alone.  and holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.  was it all selfpity loneliness or low spirits or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer who shall say     chapter fortythree surprises   jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking. it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk. no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on beths little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished. almost twentyfive and nothing to show for it. jo was mistaken in that. there was a good deal to show and byandby she saw and was grateful for it.  an old maid thats what im to be. a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson im old and cant enjoy it solitary and cant share it independent and dont need it. well i neednt be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but... and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting.  it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to fiveandtwenty. but its not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in ones self to fall back upon. at twentyfive girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be. at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. dont laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in gods sight. even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason. and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. that rosy cheeks dont last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that byandby kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.  gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color. just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. the brighteyed girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world.  jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly lauries ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didnt like to show it. but like jenny in the ballad...  she could not think it he  and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped and kissed her. then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully...  oh my teddy oh my teddy  dear jo you are glad to see me then  glad my blessed boy words cant express my gladness. wheres amy  your mother has got her down at megs. we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.  your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.  oh the dickens now ive done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down on him like a flash.  youve gone and got married  yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph.  actually married  very much so thank you.  mercy on us. what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp.  a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction.  what can you expect when you take ones breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it.  not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade.  jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we dont need it now. so come and fess teddy.  how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content.  what does amy call you  my lord.  thats like her. well you look it and jos eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.  the pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart. both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them. it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity...  dont i look like a married man and the head of a family  not a bit and you never will. youve grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever.  now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely.  how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i cant keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion.  its no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently. i couldnt wait. i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream.  of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end. now start right and tell me how it all happened. im pining to know.  well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim...  fib number one. amy did it to please you. go on and tell the truth if you can sir.  now shes beginning to marm it. isnt it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed. its all the same you know she and i being one. we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris. but grandpa wanted to come home. he went to please me and i couldnt let him go alone neither could i leave amy and mrs. carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and wouldnt let amy come with us. so i just settled the difficulty by saying lets be married and then we can do as we like.  of course you did. you always have things to suit you.  not always and something in lauries voice made jo say hastily...  how did you ever get aunt to agree  it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side. there wasnt time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it byandby and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says.  arent we proud of those two words and dont we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.  a trifle perhaps shes such a captivating little woman i cant help being proud of her. well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety. we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round so we did it.  when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle.  six weeks ago at the american consuls in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we didnt forget dear little beth.  jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well.  why didnt you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute.  we wanted to surprise you. we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he couldnt be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. my faith wasnt it love among the roses  laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the halfinvoluntary impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before...  jo dear i want to say one thing and then well put it by forever. as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is. amy and you changed places in my heart thats all. i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache. i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself. upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i didnt know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike. but i couldnt and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once. you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them dearly. will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another  ill believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again. the happy old times cant come back and we mustnt expect it. we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking. im sure you feel this. i see the change in you and youll find it in me. i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would. we cant be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives wont we laurie  he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both. presently jo said cheerfully for she didnt want the coming home to be a sad one i cant make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping. why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning amys pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased. mercy me how time does fly  as one of the children is older than yourself you neednt talk so like a grandma. i flatter myself im a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy youll find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air.  you may be a little older in years but im ever so much older in feeling teddy. women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty.  poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring. you are older. heres a line and theres another. unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it. youve had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone. what a selfish beast ive been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look.  but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful no i had father and mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear. i am lonely sometimes but i dare say its good for me and...  you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill. amy and i cant get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together.  if i shouldnt be in the way it would be very pleasant. i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him.  he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming.  you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next. you look a little wicked now. what is it grandma  i was wondering how you and amy get on together.  like angels  yes of course but which rules  i dont mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think so it pleases her you know. byandby we shall take turns for marriage they say halves ones rights and doubles ones duties.  youll go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life.  well she does it so imperceptibly that i dont think i shall mind much. she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while.  that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands.  it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too wellbred for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it. my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.  jo liked that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure.  i am sure of that. amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember.  she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie. such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings a regular rouser. ill tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the goodfornothing.  what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and ill defend you.  i look as if i needed it dont i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as amys voice was heard calling where is she wheres my dear old jo  in trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. mr. laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone and the oldfashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair. it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.  the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress hadnt a parisian air that young mrs. moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs. laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment to him. mrs. march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness.  for amys face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning. no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become.  love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly.  she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr. march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.  daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms. demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne. a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him.  young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face. now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.  blest if she aint in silk from head to foot aint it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle and hear folks calling little amy mis. laurence muttered old hannah who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.  mercy on us how they did talk first one then the other then all burst out togethertrying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. it was fortunate that tea was at hand to produce a lull and provide refreshmentfor they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room mr. march proudly escorted mrs. laurence. mrs. march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son. the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by the fire that made jo whisper back ill try to fill her place sir.  the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity. didnt they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass didnt they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that dodos sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who hadnt his spectacles on. amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father laurences arm. the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless. she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer hannahs eager inquiry.  will miss amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes thats stored away over yander  shouldnt wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day. teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction.  no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose.  i dont care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then. she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as demis short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her. if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself ill weep a little weep when i go to bed. it wont do to be dismal now. then she drew her hand over her eyes for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door.  she opened with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.  oh mr. bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.  and i to see miss marsch but no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them.  no we havent only the family. my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy. come in and make one of us.  though a very social man i think mr. bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.  if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all. you haf been ill my friend  he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it.  not ill but tired and sorrowful. we have had trouble since i saw you last.  ah yes i know. my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand.  father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.  if the stranger had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. everyone greeted him kindly for jos sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own. they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor. for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. mr. bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home. the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity. the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr. march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his guests benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr. laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.  if jo had not been otherwise engaged lauries behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. but it did not last long. he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle. for mr. bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice. he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime. then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt.  a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. mr. bhaers face had lost the absentminded expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment. then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic. jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her fathers absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr. bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but didnt stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a jovelike aspect. poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr. bhaer actually had gold sleevebuttons in his immaculate wristbands.  dear old fellow he couldnt have got himself up with more care if hed been going awooing said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face.  the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball. of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them.  nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr. laurence went home to rest. the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of bed and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go.  we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.  they were not all there. but no one found the words thoughtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made dissoluble. the little chair stood in its old place. the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf. the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it beths face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy. i am here.  play something amy. let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.  but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear. i cant show off tonight.  but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sang beths songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the listeners hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of beths favorite hymn. it was hard to say...  earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal   and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without beths kiss.  now we must finish with mignons song for mr. bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful. and mr. bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying...  you will sing with me we go excellently well together.  a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper. but she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless of time and tune. it didnt much matter for mr. bhaer sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.  knowst thou the land where the citron blooms   used to be the professors favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words...  there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go   and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.  the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels. but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and no one had called her by her new name since he came. he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting...  my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir. please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.  then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.  i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days.  he spoke to mrs. march but he looked at jo and the mothers voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughters eyes for mrs. march was not so blind to her childrens interest as mrs. moffat supposed.  i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr. march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone.  i know he is a good one added mrs. march with decided approval as she wound up the clock.  i thought youd like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed.  she wondered what the business was that brought mr. bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact. if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark.     chapter fortyfour my lord and lady   please madam mother could you lend me my wife for half an hour the luggage has come and ive been making hay of amys paris finery trying to find some things i want said laurie coming in the next day to find mrs. laurence sitting in her mothers lap as if being made the baby again.  certainly. go dear i forgot that you have any home but this and mrs. march pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.  i shouldnt have come over if i could have helped it but i cant get on without my little woman any more than a...  weathercock can without the wind suggested jo as he paused for a simile. jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since teddy came home.  exactly for amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time with only an occasional whiffle round to the south and i havent had an easterly spell since i was married. dont know anything about the north but am altogether salubrious and balmy hey my lady  lovely weather so far. i dont know how long it will last but im not afraid of storms for im learning how to sail my ship. come home dear and ill find your bootjack. i suppose thats what you are rummaging after among my things. men are so helpless mother said amy with a matronly air which delighted her husband.  what are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled asked jo buttoning amys cloak as she used to button her pinafores.  we have our plans. we dont mean to say much about them yet because we are such very new brooms but we dont intend to be idle. im going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather and prove to him that im not spoiled. i need something of the sort to keep me steady. im tired of dawdling and mean to work like a man.  and amy what is she going to do asked mrs. march well pleased at lauries decision and the energy with which he spoke.  after doing the civil all round and airing our best bonnet we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion the brilliant society we shall draw about us and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large. thats about it isnt it madame recamier asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy.  time will show. come away impertinence and dont shock my family by calling me names before their faces answered amy resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society.  how happy those children seem together observed mr. march finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone.  yes and i think it will last added mrs. march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.  i know it will. happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.  later in the evening when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack laurie said suddenly to his wife mrs. laurence.  my lord  that man intends to marry our jo  i hope so dont you dear  well my love i consider him a trump in the fullest sense of that expressive word but i do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer.  now laurie dont be too fastidious and worldlyminded. if they love one another it doesnt matter a particle how old they are nor how poor. women never should marry for money... amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her and looked at her husband who replied with malicious gravity...  certainly not though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. if my memory serves me you once thought it your duty to make a rich match. that accounts perhaps for your marrying a goodfornothing like me.  oh my dearest boy dont dont say that i forgot you were rich when i said yes. id have married you if you hadnt a penny and i sometimes wish you were poor that i might show how much i love you. and amy who was very dignified in public and very fond in private gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.  you dont really think i am such a mercenary creature as i tried to be once do you it would break my heart if you didnt believe that id gladly pull in the same boat with you even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake.  am i an idiot and a brute how could i think so when you refused a richer man for me and wont let me give you half i want to now when i have the right girls do it every day poor things and are taught to think it is their only salvation but you had better lessons and though i trembled for you at one time i was not disappointed for the daughter was true to the mothers teaching. i told mamma so yesterday and she looked as glad and grateful as if id given her a check for a million to be spent in charity. you are not listening to my moral remarks mrs. laurence and laurie paused for amys eyes had an absent look though fixed upon his face.  yes i am and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. i dont wish to make you vain but i must confess that im prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. dont laugh but your nose is such a comfort to me and amy softly caressed the wellcut feature with artistic satisfaction.  laurie had received many compliments in his life but never one that suited him better as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wifes peculiar taste while she said slowly may i ask you a question dear  of course you may.  shall you care if jo does marry mr. bhaer  oh thats the trouble is it i thought there was something in the dimple that didnt quite suit you. not being a dog in the manger but the happiest fellow alive i assure you i can dance at jos wedding with a heart as light as my heels. do you doubt it my darling  amy looked up at him and was satisfied. her little jealous fear vanished forever and she thanked him with a face full of love and confidence.  i wish we could do something for that capital old professor. couldnt we invent a rich relation who shall obligingly die out there in germany and leave him a tidy little fortune said laurie when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room arm in arm as they were fond of doing in memory of the chateau garden.  jo would find us out and spoil it all. she is very proud of him just as he is and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing.  bless her dear heart she wont think so when she has a literary husband and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. we wont interfere now but watch our chance and do them a good turn in spite of themselves. i owe jo for a part of my education and she believes in peoples paying their honest debts so ill get round her in that way.  how delightful it is to be able to help others isnt it that was always one of my dreams to have the power of giving freely and thanks to you the dream has come true.  ah well do quantities of good wont we theres one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help. outandout beggars get taken care of but poor gentle folks fare badly because they wont ask and people dont dare to offer charity. yet there are a thousand ways of helping them if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend. i must say i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. i suppose its wrong but i do though it is harder.  because it takes a gentleman to do it added the other member of the domestic admiration society.  thank you im afraid i dont deserve that pretty compliment. but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices and enduring real hardships that they might realize their dreams. splendid fellows some of them working like heros poor and friendless but so full of courage patience and ambition that i was ashamed of myself and longed to give them a right good lift. those are people whom its a satisfaction to help for if theyve got genius its an honor to be allowed to serve them and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling. if they havent its a pleasure to comfort the poor souls and keep them from despair when they find it out.  yes indeed and theres another class who cant ask and who suffer in silence. i know something of it for i belonged to it before you made a princess of me as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story. ambitious girls have a hard time laurie and often have to see youth health and precious opportunities go by just for want of a little help at the right minute. people have been very kind to me and whenever i see girls struggling along as we used to do i want to put out my hand and help them as i was helped.  and so you shall like an angel as you are cried laurie resolving with a glow of philanthropic zeal to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves or let their money accumulate for others to waste. its not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive and enjoy making ones fellow creatures happy with it. well have a good time ourselves and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste. will you be a little dorcas going about emptying a big basket of comforts and filling it up with good deeds  with all my heart if you will be a brave st. martin stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.  its a bargain and we shall get the best of it  so the young pair shook hands upon it and then paced happily on again feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them if they smoothed rough ways for other feet and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.     chapter fortyfive daisy and demi   i cannot feel that i have done my duty as humble historian of the march family without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it. daisy and demi had now arrived at years of discretion for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights and get them too which is more than many of their elders do. if there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration it was these prattling brookes. of course they were the most remarkable children ever born as will be shown when i mention that they walked at eight months talked fluently at twelve months and at two years they took their places at table and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. at three daisy demanded a needler and actually made a bag with four stitches in it. she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to hannahs eyes while demi learned his letters with his grandfather who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. the boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother for he tried to imitate every machine he saw and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition with his sewinsheen a mysterious structure of string chairs clothespins and spools for wheels to go wound and wound. also a basket hung over the back of a chair in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister who with feminine devotion allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued when the young inventor indignantly remarked why marmar dats my lellywaiter and mes trying to pull her up.  though utterly unlike in character the twins got on remarkably well together and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. of course demi tyrannized over daisy and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor while daisy made a galley slave of herself and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. a rosy chubby sunshiny little soul was daisy who found her way to everybodys heart and nestled there. one of the captivating children who seem made to be kissed and cuddled adorned and adored like little goddesses and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. it was all fair weather in her world and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out and say no matter whether it rained or shone oh pitty day oh pitty day everyone was a friend and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented and babylovers became faithful worshipers.  me loves evvybody she once said opening her arms with her spoon in one hand and her mug in the other as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world.  as she grew her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. her grandfather often called her beth and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion as if trying to atone for some past mistake which no eye but her own could see.  demi like a true yankee was of an inquiring turn wanting to know everything and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual what for  he also possessed a philosophic bent to the great delight of his grandfather who used to hold socratic conversations with him in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.  what makes my legs go dranpa asked the young philosopher surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air while resting after a gotobed frolic one night.  its your little mind demi replied the sage stroking the yellow head respectfully.  what is a little mine  it is something which makes your body move as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when i showed it to you.  open me. i want to see it go wound.  i cant do that any more than you could open the watch. god winds you up and you go till he stops you.  does i and demis brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought. is i wounded up like the watch  yes but i cant show you how for it is done when we dont see.  demi felt his back as if expecting to find it like that of the watch and then gravely remarked i dess dod does it when is asleep.  a careful explanation followed to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said my dear do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby hes getting great bumps over his eyes and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.  if he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers. i am not putting the thoughts into his head but helping him unfold those already there. these children are wiser than we are and i have no doubt the boy understands every word i have said to him. now demi tell me where you keep your mind.  if the boy had replied like alcibiades by the gods socrates i cannot tell his grandfather would not have been surprised but when after standing a moment on one leg like a meditative young stork he answered in a tone of calm conviction in my little belly the old gentleman could only join in grandmas laugh and dismiss the class in metaphysics.  there might have been cause for maternal anxiety if demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy as well as a budding philosopher for often after a discussion which caused hannah to prophesy with ominous nods that child aint long for this world he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear dirty naughty little rascals distract and delight their parents souls.  meg made many moral rules and tried to keep them but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles the ingenious evasions or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished artful dodgers  no more raisins demi. theyll make you sick says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plumpudding day.  me likes to be sick.  i dont want to have you so run away and help daisy make patty cakes.  he reluctantly departs but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit and byandby when an opportunity comes to redress them he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain.  now you have been good children and ill play anything you like says meg as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.  truly marmar asks demi with a brilliant idea in his wellpowdered head.  yes truly. anything you say replies the shortsighted parent preparing herself to sing the three little kittens half a dozen times over or to take her family to buy a penny bun regardless of wind or limb. but demi corners her by the cool reply...  then well go and eat up all the raisins.  aunt dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children and the trio turned the little house topsyturvy. aunt amy was as yet only a name to them aunt beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory but aunt dodo was a living reality and they made the most of her for which compliment she was deeply grateful. but when mr. bhaer came jo neglected her playfellows and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls. daisy who was fond of going about peddling kisses lost her best customer and became bankrupt. demi with infantile penetration soon discovered that dodo like to play with the bearman better than she did him but though hurt he concealed his anguish for he hadnt the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.  some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes but demi didnt see it in that light and continued to patronize the the bearman with pensive affability while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call and considered his shoulder her throne his arm her refuge his gifts treasures surpassing worth.  gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them and does not deceive anybody a particle. mr. bhaers devotion was sincere however likewise effectivefor honesty is the best policy in love as in law. he was one of the men who are at home with children and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one. his business whatever it was detained him from day to day but evening seldom failed to bring him out to seewell he always asked for mr. march so i suppose he was the attraction. the excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.  mr. bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. prone upon the floor lay mr. march with his respectable legs in the air and beside him likewise prone was demi trying to imitate the attitude with his own short scarletstockinged legs both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators till mr. bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh and jo cried out with a scandalized face...  father father heres the professor  down went the black legs and up came the gray head as the preceptor said with undisturbed dignity good evening mr. bhaer. excuse me for a moment. we are just finishing our lesson. now demi make the letter and tell its name.  i knows him and after a few convulsive efforts the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted its a we dranpa its a we  hes a born weller laughed jo as her parent gathered himself up and her nephew tried to stand on his head as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.  what have you been at today bubchen asked mr. bhaer picking up the gymnast.  me went to see little mary.  and what did you there  i kissed her began demi with artless frankness.  prut thou beginnest early. what did the little mary say to that asked mr. bhaer continuing to confess the young sinner who stood upon the knee exploring the waistcoat pocket.  oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it. dont little boys like little girls asked demi with his mouth full and an air of bland satisfaction.  you precocious chick who put that into your head said jo enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the professor.  tisnt in mine head its in mine mouf answered literal demi putting out his tongue with a chocolate drop on it thinking she alluded to confectionery not ideas.  thou shouldst save some for the little friend. sweets to the sweet mannling and mr. bhaer offered jo some with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. demi also saw the smile was impressed by it and artlessy inquired. ..  do great boys like great girls to fessor  like young washington mr. bhaer couldnt tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr. march put down his clothesbrush glance at jos retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.  why dodo when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever.     chapter fortysix under the umbrella   while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr. bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields.  i always do take a walk toward evening and i dont know why i should give it up just because i happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to megs whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning. he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her until quite close when he would look as if his shortsighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. then if she was going to megs he always had something for the babies. if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls.  under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as friedrichi mean mr. bhaerdoesnt like tea.  by the second week everyone knew perfectly well what was going on yet everyone tried to look as if they were stoneblind to the changes in jos face. they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise. and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love.  jo couldnt even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life. she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence. laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr. bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to jos improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the professors hat on the marches table nearly every evening. but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.  for a fortnight the professor came and went with loverlike regularity. then he stayed away for three whole days and made no sign a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and thenalas for romancevery cross.  disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came. its nothing to me of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon.  youd better take the little umbrella dear. it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact.  yes marmee do you want anything in town ive got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.  yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak  i believe so answered jo absently.  if you happen to meet mr. bhaer bring him home to tea. i quite long to see the dear man added mrs. march.  jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who havent any mothers to help them through their troubles  the drygoods stores were not down among the countinghouses banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for someone examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over barrels being halfsmothered by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there. a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons. for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet. now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz  co. over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air...  it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo im ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends. you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet its no more than you deserve. now then  with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon maam and looked mortally offended. somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr. bhaer looking down.  i feel to know the strongminded lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses and so fast through much mud. what do you down here my friend  im shopping.  mr. bhaer smiled as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but he only said politely you haf no umbrella. may i go also and take for you the bundles  yes thank you.  jos cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she didnt care for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day.  we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her. her bonnet wasnt big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.  did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily...  no i didnt. i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed you father and mother especially.  and you  im always glad to see you sir.  in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely...  i thank you and come one more time before i go.  you are going then  i haf no longer any business here it is done.  successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his.  i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my junglings much help.  tell me please i like to know all about thethe boys said jo eagerly.  that is so kind i gladly tell you. my friends find for me a place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil. for this i should be grateful should i not  indeed you should. how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.  ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west.  so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it didnt matter now what became of her clothes or herself.  mr. bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet. he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose. when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such a chilly formal reply that despair fell upon him. on learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter...  heres the place for my errands. will you come in it wont take long.  jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss. she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter. mr. bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries.  when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole.  should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers.  what will we buy asked jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in.  may they haf oranges and figs asked mr. bhaer with a paternal air.  they eat them when they can get them.  do you care for nuts  like a squirrel.  hamburg grapes. yes we shall drink to the fatherland in those  jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he didnt buy a frail of dates a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and be done with it whereat mr. bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they traveled on again.  miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block.  yes sir and jos heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it.  i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me.  yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it.  i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone. will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help  yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator.  perhaps also a shawl for tinas mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care. yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother.  ill do it with pleasure mr. bhaer. im going very fast and hes getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold.  mr. bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls. the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family.  your lady may prefer this. its a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over jos shoulders.  does this suit you mr. bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.  excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargainhunter.  now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him.  yes its late and im so tired. jos voice was more pathetic than she knew. for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out and the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter. mr. bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better. with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.  this is not our omniboos said the professor waving the loaded vehicle away and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.  i beg your pardon. i didnt see the name distinctly. never mind i can walk. im used to plodding in the mud returned jo winking hard because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.  mr. bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away. the sight seemed to touch him very much for suddenly stooping down he asked in a tone that meant a great deal hearts dearest why do you cry  now if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasnt crying had a cold in her head or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion. instead of which that undignified creature answered with an irrepressible sob because you are going away.  ach mein gott that is so good cried mr. bhaer managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles jo i haf nothing but much love to gif you. i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend. am i can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz he added all in one breath.  oh yes said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his arm and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it.  it was certainly proposing under difficulties for even if he had desired to do so mr. bhaer could not go down upon his knees on account of the mud. neither could he offer jo his hand except figuratively for both were full. much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street though he was near it. so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. if he had not loved jo very much i dont think he could have done it then for she looked far from lovely with her skirts in a deplorable state her rubber boots splashed to the ankle and her bonnet a ruin. fortunately mr. bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living and she found him more jovelike than ever though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders for he held the umbrella all over jo and every finger of his gloves needed mending.  passersby probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics for they entirely forgot to hail a bus and strolled leisurely along oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. little they cared what anybody thought for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life the magical moment which bestows youth on the old beauty on the plain wealth on the poor and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. the professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss. while jo trudged beside him feeling as if her place had always been there and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot. of course she was the first to speakintelligibly i mean for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous oh yes were not of a coherent or reportable character.  friedrich why didnt you...  ah heaven she gifs me the name that no one speaks since minna died cried the professor pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight.  i always call you so to myselfi forgot but i wont unless you like it.  like it it is more sweet to me than i can tell. say thou also and i shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.  isnt thou a little sentimental asked jo privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable.  sentimental yes. thank gott we germans believe in sentiment and keep ourselves young mit it. your english you is so cold say thou hearts dearest it means so much to me pleaded mr. bhaer more like a romantic student than a grave professor.  well then why didnt thou tell me all this sooner asked jo bashfully.  now i shall haf to show thee all my heart and i so gladly will because thou must take care of it hereafter. see then my joah the dear funny little namei had a wish to tell something the day i said goodbye in new york but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee and so i spoke not. wouldst thou have said yes then if i had spoken  i dont know. im afraid not for i didnt have any heart just then.  prut that i do not believe. it was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood and waked it up. ah well die erste liebe ist die beste but that i should not expect.  yes the first love is the best but be so contented for i never had another. teddy was only a boy and soon got over his little fancy said jo anxious to correct the professors mistake.  good then i shall rest happy and be sure that thou givest me all. i haf waited so long i am grown selfish as thou wilt find professorin.  i like that cried jo delighted with her new name. now tell me what brought you at last just when i wanted you  this and mr. bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket.  jo unfolded it and looked much abashed for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.  how could that bring you she asked wondering what he meant.  i found it by chance. i knew it by the names and the initials and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. read and find him. i will see that you go not in the wet.  in the garret   four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time all fashioned and filled long ago by children now in their prime. four little keys hung side by side with faded ribbons brave and gay when fastened there with childish pride long ago on a rainy day. four little names one on each lid carved out by a boyish hand and underneath there lieth hid histories of the happy band once playing here and pausing oft to hear the sweet refrain that came and went on the roof aloft in the falling summer rain.   meg on the first lid smooth and fair. i look in with loving eyes for folded here with wellknown care a goodly gathering lies the record of a peaceful life gifts to gentle child and girl a bridal gown lines to a wife a tiny shoe a baby curl. no toys in this first chest remain for all are carried away in their old age to join again in another small megs play. ah happy mother well i know you hear like a sweet refrain lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain.   jo on the next lid scratched and worn and within a motley store of headless dolls of schoolbooks torn birds and beasts that speak no more spoils brought home from the fairy ground only trod by youthful feet dreams of a future never found memories of a past still sweet halfwrit poems stories wild april letters warm and cold diaries of a wilful child hints of a woman early old a woman in a lonely home hearing like a sad refrain be worthy love and love will come in the falling summer rain.   my beth the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name as if by loving eyes that wept by careful hands that often came. death canonized for us one saint ever less human than divine and still we lay with tender plaint relics in this household shrine the silver bell so seldom rung the little cap which last she wore the fair dead catherine that hung by angels borne above her door. the songs she sang without lament in her prisonhouse of pain forever are they sweetly blent with the falling summer rain.   upon the last lids polished field legend now both fair and true a gallant knight bears on his shield amy in letters gold and blue. within lie snoods that bound her hair slippers that have danced their last faded flowers laid by with care fans whose airy toils are past gay valentines all ardent flames trifles that have borne their part in girlish hopes and fears and shames the record of a maiden heart now learning fairer truer spells hearing like a blithe refrain the silver sound of bridal bells in the falling summer rain.   four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time four women taught by weal and woe to love and labor in their prime. four sisters parted for an hour none lost one only gone before made by loves immortal power nearest and dearest evermore. oh when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the fathers sight may they be rich in golden hours deeds that show fairer for the light lives whose brave music long shall ring like a spiritstirring strain souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain.   its very bad poetry but i felt it when i wrote it one day when i was very lonely and had a good cry on a rag bag. i never thought it would go where it could tell tales said jo tearing up the verses the professor had treasured so long.  let it go it has done its duty and i will haf a fresh one when i read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets said mr. bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind. yes he added earnestly i read that and i think to myself she has a sorrow she is lonely she would find comfort in true love. i haf a heart full full for her. shall i not go and say if this is not too poor a thing to gif for what i shall hope to receive take it in gotts name  and so you came to find that it was not too poor but the one precious thing i needed whispered jo.  i had no courage to think that at first heavenly kind as was your welcome to me. but soon i began to hope and then i said i will haf her if i die for it and so i will cried mr. bhaer with a defiant nod as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.  jo thought that was splendid and resolved to be worthy of her knight though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.  what made you stay away so long she asked presently finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent.  it was not easy but i could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until i could haf a prospect of one to gif you after much time perhaps and hard work. how could i ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow who has no fortune but a little learning  im glad you are poor. i couldnt bear a rich husband said jo decidedly adding in a softer tone dont fear poverty. ive known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and dont call yourself oldforty is the prime of life. i couldnt help loving you if you were seventy  the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it. as he couldnt jo wiped his eyes for him and said laughing as she took away a bundle or two...  i may be strongminded but no one can say im out of my sphere now for womans special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens. im to carry my share friedrich and help to earn the home. make up your mind to that or ill never go she added resolutely as he tried to reclaim his load.  we shall see. haf you patience to wait a long time jo i must go away and do my work alone. i must help my boys first because even for you i may not break my word to minna. can you forgif that and be happy while we hope and wait  yes i know i can for we love one another and that makes all the rest easy to bear. i have my duty also and my work. i couldnt enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so theres no need of hurry or impatience. you can do your part out west i can do mine here and both be happy hoping for the best and leaving the future to be as god wills.  ah thou gifest me such hope and courage and i haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands cried the professor quite overcome.  jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella. it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of draggletailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness. though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door.     chapter fortyseven harvest time   for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said. the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly. but when their first sorrow was overfor they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tonguethey found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible.  its a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later.  no i dont was jos decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress.  you dont mean to live there  yes i do.  but my dear girl its an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order. the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming isnt in bhaers line i take it.  hell try his hand at it there if i propose it.  and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but youll find it desperate hard work.  the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed.  of what is this fine crop to consist maam  boys. i want to open a school for little ladsa good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them.  thats a truly joian plan for you isnt that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he.  i like it said mrs. march decidedly.  so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth.  it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head of her one allabsorbing son.  jo can do it and be happy in it. its a splendid idea. tell us all about it cried mr. laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help.  i knew youd stand by me sir. amy does tooi see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks. now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this isnt a new idea of mine but a long cherished plan. before my fritz came i used to think how when id made my fortune and no one needed me at home id hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who hadnt any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late. i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles and oh i should so like to be a mother to them  mrs. march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while.  i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich. bless his dear heart hes been doing it all his lifehelping poor boys i mean not getting rich that hell never be. money doesnt stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any. but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved im rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school. its just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain. theres plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside. they could help in the garden and orchard. such work is healthy isnt it sir then fritz could train and teach in his own way and father will help him. i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my standby. ive always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my hearts content. think what luxury plumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.  as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr. laurence laughed till they thought hed have an apoplectic fit.  i dont see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard. nothing could be more natural and proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.  she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke. but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins im afraid your crop wont be profitable in a worldly sense mrs. bhaer.  now dont be a wetblanket teddy. of course i shall have rich pupils alsoperhaps begin with such altogether. then when ive got a start i can take in a ragamuffin or two just for a relish. rich peoples children often need care and comfort as well as poor. ive seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when its real cruelty. some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect and some lose their mothers. besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and thats the very time they need most patience and kindness. people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men. they dont complain muchplucky little soulsbut they feel it. ive been through something of it and i know all about it. ive a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest wellmeaning boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsyturvy heads. ive had experience too for havent i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family  ill testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look.  and ive succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible businessman doing heaps of good with your money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars. but you are not merely a businessman you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times. i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you wont let them say so. yes and when i have my flock ill just point to you and say theres your model my lads.  poor laurie didnt know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.  i say jo thats rather too much he began just in his old boyish way. you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disappoint you. you have rather cast me off lately jo but ive had the best of help nevertheless. so if ive got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his grandfathers head and the other on amys golden one for the three were never far apart.  i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then. when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best. if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly. and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth.  it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield. then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr. laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support. in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.  of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim wellordered plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the bhaergarten as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.  it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to bea happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness. every room in the big house was soon full. every little plot in the garden soon had its owner. a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed. and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer. she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety. but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven. very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more. there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the bhaergarten though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school.  yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket. she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers. as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her happinessrob named for grandpa and teddy a happygolucky baby who seemed to have inherited his papas sunshiny temper as well as his mothers lively spirit. how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well.  there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly applepicking. for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it. five years after jos wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins. the old orchard wore its holiday attire. goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast. squirrels were busy with their small harvesting. birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake. everybody was there. everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down. everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.  mr. march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr. laurence while enjoying...  the gentle apples winey juice.  the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a bushelbasket took daisy up among the birds nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck. mrs. march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him.  jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up and her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes. she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly.  at four oclock a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an outofdoor tea was always the crowning joy of the day. the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they likedfreedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul. they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. the little girls had a private tea party and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will.  when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such timesaunt march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green.  now grandmas sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three  that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it. everybodys health was proposed from mr. laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guinea pig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master. demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to grandmasfor the childrens gifts were all their own. every stitch daisys patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs. march. demis miracle of mechanical skill though the cover wouldnt shut robs footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing and no page of the costly book amys child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the wordsto dear grandma from her little beth.  during the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs. march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing. then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs. march couldnt get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all.  after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs. march and her daughters under the festival tree.  i dont think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs. bhaer taking teddys little fist out of the milk pitcher in which he was rapturously churning.  and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago. do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys.  dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now. i havent given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and im sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the professors arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them.  my castle was the most nearly realized of all. i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these. ive got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall boys head with a face full of tender and devout content.  my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i dont relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty. ive begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ive ever done. i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel.  as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one wellbeloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over amys sunshine. this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. amys nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender. laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for ...  into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary.   she is growing better i am sure of it my dear. dont despond but hope and keep happy said mrs. march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousins pale one.  i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly. he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i cant love him enough. so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god im a happy woman.  theres no need for me to say it for everyone can see that im far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her. fritz is getting gray and stout. im growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty. we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke sweetfern cigars under the bedclothes though hes set himself afire three times already. but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life. excuse the remark but living among boys i cant help using their expressions now and then.  yes jo i think your harvest will be a good one began mrs. march frightening away a big black cricket that was staring teddy out of countenance.  not half so good as yours mother. here it is and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done cried jo with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.  i hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year said amy softly.  a large sheaf but i know theres room in your heart for it marmee dear added megs tender voice.  touched to the heart mrs. march could only stretch out her arms as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself and say with face and voice full of motherly love gratitude and humility...  oh my girls however long you may live i never can wish you a greater happiness than this       ',\n",
       " ' metamorphosis      metamorphosis  by franz kafka  translated by david wyllie     i   one morning when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. he lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. the bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. his many legs pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he looked.  whats happened to me he thought. it wasnt a dream. his room a proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. a collection of textile samples lay spread out on the tablesamsa was a travelling salesmanand above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame. it showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.  gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel quite sad. how about if i sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his present state couldnt get into that position. however hard he threw himself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was. he must have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that he wouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped when he began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt before.  oh god he thought what a strenuous career it is that ive chosen travelling day in and day out. doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home and on top of that theres the curse of travelling worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. it can all go to hell he felt a slight itch up on his belly pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better found where the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didnt know what to make of and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.  he slid back into his former position. getting up early all the time he thought it makes you stupid. youve got to get enough sleep. other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. for instance whenever i go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. i ought to just try that with my boss id get kicked out on the spot. but who knows maybe that would be the best thing for me. if i didnt have my parents to think about id have given in my notice a long time ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell him everything i would let him know just what i feel. hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. well theres still some hope once ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to himanother five or six years i supposethats definitely what ill do. thats when ill make the big change. first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five.  and he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest of drawers. god in heaven he thought. it was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than half past more like quarter to seven. had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been it certainly must have rung. yes but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise true he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply because of that. what should he do now the next train went at seven if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about gregors not being there a long time ago. the office assistant was the bosss man spineless and with no understanding. what about if he reported sick but that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service gregor had never once yet been ill. his boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy. and whats more would he have been entirely wrong in this case gregor did in fact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.  he was still hurriedly thinking all this through unable to decide to get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to seven. there was a cautious knock at the door near his head. gregor somebody calledit was his motherits quarter to seven. didnt you want to go somewhere that gentle voice gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. as if from deep inside him there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything but in the circumstances contented himself with saying yes mother yes thankyou im getting up now. the change in gregors voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. but this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that gregor against their expectations was still at home and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors gently but with his fist. gregor gregor he called whats wrong and after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice gregor gregor at the other side door his sister came plaintively gregor arent you well do you need anything gregor answered to both sides im ready now making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each individual word. his father went back to his breakfast but his sister whispered gregor open the door i beg of you. gregor however had no thought of opening the door and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit acquired from his travelling of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.  the first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast. only then would he consider what to do next as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. he remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed perhaps caused by lying awkwardly but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. he did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.  it was a simple matter to throw off the covers he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. but it became difficult after that especially as he was so exceptionally broad. he would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions and which he was moreover unable to control. if he wanted to bend one of them then that was the first one that would stretch itself out and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. this is something that cant be done in bed gregor said to himself so dont keep trying to do it.  the first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed but he had never seen this lower part and could not imagine what it looked like it turned out to be too hard to move it went so slowly and finally almost in a frenzy when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather he chose the wrong direction hit hard against the lower bedpost and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well at present be the most sensitive.  so then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first carefully turning his head to the side. this he managed quite easily and despite its breadth and its weight the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. but when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. and he could not knock himself out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.  it took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier but when he lay there sighing and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before if that was possible he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. he told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. at the same time though he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. at times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could but unfortunately even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. seven oclock already he said to himself when the clock struck again seven oclock and theres still a fog like this. and he lay there quietly a while longer breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.  but then he said to himself before it strikes quarter past seven ill definitely have to have got properly out of bed. and by then somebody will have come round from work to ask whats happened to me as well as they open up at work before seven oclock. and so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. if he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. his back seemed to be quite hard and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. his main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. but it was something that had to be risked.  when gregor was already sticking half way out of the bedthe new method was more of a game than an effort all he had to do was rock back and forthit occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. two strong peoplehe had his father and the maid in mindwould have been more than enough they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back peel him away from the bed bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor where hopefully the little legs would find a use. should he really call for help though even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked despite all the difficulty he was in he could not suppress a smile at this thought.  after a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. the time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. then there was a ring at the door of the flat. thatll be someone from work he said to himself and froze very still although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around. for a moment everything remained quiet. theyre not opening the door gregor said to himself caught in some nonsensical hope. but then of course the maids firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. gregor only needed to hear the visitors first words of greeting and he knew who it wasthe chief clerk himself. why did gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming were all employees every one of them louts was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiriesassuming enquiries were even necessarydid the chief clerk have to come himself and did they have to show the whole innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it and more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. there was a loud thump but it wasnt really a loud noise. his fall was softened a little by the carpet and gregors back was also more elastic than he had thought which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. he had not held his head carefully enough though and hit it as he fell annoyed and in pain he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.  somethings fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the room on the left. gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too you had to concede that it was possible. but as if in gruff reply to this question the chief clerks firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. from the room on his right gregors sister whispered to him to let him know gregor the chief clerk is here. yes i know said gregor to himself but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.  gregor said his father now from the room to his left the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didnt leave on the early train. we dont know what to say to him. and anyway he wants to speak to you personally. so please open up this door. im sure hell be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room. then the chief clerk called good morning mr. samsa. he isnt well said his mother to the chief clerk while his father continued to speak through the door. he isnt well please believe me. why else would gregor have missed a train the lad only ever thinks about the business. it nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. he sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. his idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. hes made a little frame for instance it only took him two or three evenings youll be amazed how nice it is its hanging up in his room youll see it as soon as gregor opens the door. anyway im glad youre here we wouldnt have been able to get gregor to open the door by ourselves hes so stubborn and im sure he isnt well he said this morning that he is but he isnt. ill be there in a moment said gregor slowly and thoughtfully but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. well i cant think of any other way of explaining it mrs. samsa said the chief clerk i hope its nothing serious. but on the other hand i must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then fortunately or unfortunately as you like we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations. can the chief clerk come in to see you now then asked his father impatiently knocking at the door again. no said gregor. in the room on his right there followed a painful silence in the room on his left his sister began to cry.  so why did his sister not go and join the others she had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. and why was she crying was it because he had not got up and had not let the chief clerk in because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before there was no need to worry about things like that yet. gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family. for the time being he just lay there on the carpet and noone who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. it was only a minor discourtesy and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on it was not something for which gregor could be sacked on the spot. and it seemed to gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. but the others didnt know what was happening they were worried that would excuse their behaviour.  the chief clerk now raised his voice mr. samsa he called to him what is wrong you barricade yourself in your room give us no more than yes or no for an answer you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you failand i mention this just by the wayyou fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. im speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. i am astonished quite astonished. i thought i knew you as a calm and sensible person and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. this morning your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear its trueit had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to youbut i came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. but now that i see your incomprehensible stubbornness i no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. and nor is your position all that secure. i had originally intended to say all this to you in private but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason i dont see why your parents should not also learn of it. your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late i grant you that its not the time of year to do especially good business we recognise that but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all mr. samsa we cannot allow there to be.  but sir called gregor beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement ill open up immediately just a moment. im slightly unwell an attack of dizziness i havent been able to get up. im still in bed now. im quite fresh again now though. im just getting out of bed. just a moment. be patient its not quite as easy as id thought. im quite alright now though. its shocking what can suddenly happen to a person i was quite alright last night my parents know about it perhaps better than me i had a small symptom of it last night already. they must have noticed it. i dont know why i didnt let you know at work but you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. please dont make my parents suffer theres no basis for any of the accusations youre making nobodys ever said a word to me about any of these things. maybe you havent read the latest contracts i sent in. ill set off with the eight oclock train as well these few hours of rest have given me strength. you dont need to wait sir ill be in the office soon after you and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him  and while gregor gushed out these words hardly knowing what he was saying he made his way over to the chest of drawersthis was easily done probably because of the practise he had already had in bedwhere he now tried to get himself upright. he really did want to open the door really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk the others were being so insistent and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. if they were shocked then it would no longer be gregors responsibility and he could rest. if however they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight oclock. the first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. by now he had also calmed down and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.  did you understand a word of all that the chief clerk asked his parents surely hes not trying to make fools of us. oh god called his mother who was already in tears he could be seriously ill and were making him suffer. grete grete she then cried. mother his sister called from the other side. they communicated across gregors room. youll have to go for the doctor straight away. gregor is ill. quick get the doctor. did you hear the way gregor spoke just now that was the voice of an animal said the chief clerk with a calmness that was in contrast with his mothers screams. anna anna his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall clapping his hands get a locksmith here now and the two girls their skirts swishing immediately ran out through the hall wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. how had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly there was no sound of the door banging shut again they must have left it open people often do in homes where something awful has happened.  gregor in contrast had become much calmer. so they couldnt understand his words any more although they seemed clear enough to him clearer than beforeperhaps his ears had become used to the sound. they had realised though that there was something wrong with him and were ready to help. the first response to his situation had been confident and wise and that made him feel better. he felt that he had been drawn back in among people and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievementsalthough he did not really distinguish one from the other. whatever was said next would be crucial so in order to make his voice as clear as possible he coughed a little but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. meanwhile it had become very quiet in the next room. perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.  gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. he rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. he seemed unfortunately to have no proper teethhow was he then to grasp the keybut the lack of teeth was of course made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw he really was able to start the key turning ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. listen said the chief clerk in the next room hes turning the key. gregor was greatly encouraged by this but they all should have been calling to him his father and his mother too well done gregor they should have cried keep at it keep hold of the lock and with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts he bit on the key with all his strength paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. as the key turned round he turned around the lock with it only holding himself upright with his mouth and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. the clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was gregors sign that he could break his concentration and as he regained his breath he said to himself so i didnt need the locksmith after all. then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.  because he had to open the door in this way it was already wide open before he could be seen. he had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. he was still occupied with this difficult movement unable to pay attention to anything else when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud oh which sounded like the soughing of the wind. now he also saw himhe was the nearest to the doorhis hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. gregors mother her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerks being there looked at his father. then she unfolded her arms took two steps forward towards gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. his father looked hostile and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock gregor back into his room. then he looked uncertainly round the living room covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.  so gregor did not go into the room but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. in this way only half of his body could be seen along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. meanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless greyblack building on the other side of the streetwhich was a hospitalcould be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its faade the rain was still falling now throwing down large individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. the washing up from breakfast lay on the table there was so much of it because for gregors father breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. on the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. the door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.  now then said gregor well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm ill get dressed straight away now pack up my samples and set off. will you please just let me leave you can see he said to the chief clerk that im not stubborn and i like to do my job being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling i couldnt earn my living. so where are you going in to the office yes will you report everything accurately then its quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work but thats just the right time to remember whats been achieved in the past and consider that later on once the difficulty has been removed he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. youre well aware that im seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister so that im trapped in a difficult situation but i will work my way out of it again. please dont make things any harder for me than they are already and dont take sides against me at the office. i know that nobody likes the travellers. they think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. thats just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. but you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the staff in fact if i can say this in confidence a better overview than the boss himselfits very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. and youre also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints and its almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing we dont usually even hear about them or if at all its when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip and thats when we feel the harmful effects of whats been going on without even knowing what caused them. please dont go away at least first say something to show that you grant that im at least partly right  but the chief clerk had turned away as soon as gregor had started to speak and with protruding lips only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. he did not keep still for a moment while gregor was speaking but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. he moved very gradually as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. it was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward in a panic. in the hall he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.  gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. that was something his parents did not understand very well over the years they had become convinced that this job would provide for gregor for his entire life and besides they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. gregor though did think about the future. the chief clerk had to be held back calmed down convinced and finally won over the future of gregor and his family depended on it if only his sister were here she was clever she was already in tears while gregor was still lying peacefully on his back. and the chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. but his sister was not there gregor would have to do the job himself. and without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state or that his speech still might notor probably would notbe understood he let go of the door pushed himself through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who ridiculously was holding on to the banister with both hands but gregor fell immediately over and with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto landed on his numerous little legs. hardly had that happened than for the first time that day he began to feel alright with his body the little legs had the solid ground under them to his pleasure they did exactly as he told them they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. he held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. his mother was not far away in front of him and seemed at first quite engrossed in herself but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting help for pitys sake help the way she held her head suggested she wanted to see gregor better but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.  mother mother said gregor gently looking up at her. he had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. that set his mother screaming anew she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. gregor though had no time to spare for his parents now the chief clerk had already reached the stairs with his chin on the banister he looked back for the last time. gregor made a run for him he wanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have expected something as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase. the flight of the chief clerk seemed unfortunately to put gregors father into a panic as well. until then he had been relatively self controlled but now instead of running after the chief clerk himself or at least not impeding gregor as he ran after him gregors father seized the chief clerks stick in his right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hat and overcoat picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left and used them to drive gregor back into his room stamping his foot at him as he went. gregors appeals to his father were of no help his appeals were simply not understood however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. across the room despite the chilly weather gregors mother had pulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. a strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway the curtains flew up the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. nothing would stop gregors father as he drove him back making hissing noises at him like a wild man. gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. if gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his fathers hand any moment. eventually though gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw to his disgust that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line so he began as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father to turn himself round. it went very slowly but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. if only his father would stop that unbearable hissing it was making gregor quite confused. when he had nearly finished turning round still listening to that hissing he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. he was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. in his present mood it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that gregor would have enough space to get through. he was merely fixed on the idea that gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. nor would he ever have allowed gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. what he did making more noise than ever was to drive gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way it sounded to gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him it was not a pleasant experience and gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. one side of his body lifted itself he lay at an angle in the doorway one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured leaving vile brown flecks on it soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying and heavily bleeding deep into his room. the door was slammed shut with the stick then finally all was quiet.     ii   it was not until it was getting dark that evening that gregor awoke from his deep and comalike sleep. he would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadnt been disturbed as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. but he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. the light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture but down below where gregor was it was dark. he pushed himself over to the door feeling his way clumsily with his antennaeof which he was now beginning to learn the valuein order to see what had been happening there. the whole of his left side seemed like one painfully stretched scar and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. one of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morningit was nearly a miracle that only one of them had beenand dragged along lifelessly.  it was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it it was the smell of something to eat. by the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. he was so pleased he almost laughed as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning and immediately dipped his head into the milk nearly covering his eyes with it. but he soon drew his head back again in disappointment not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the foodhe was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling wholebut the milk did not taste at all nice. milk like this was normally his favourite drink and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that but he turned almost against his own will away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.  through the crack in the door gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room. his father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper reading it out in a loud voice to gregors mother and sometimes to his sister but there was now not a sound to be heard. gregors sister would often write and tell him about this reading but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. it was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebody in the flat. what a quiet life it is the family lead said gregor to himself and gazing into the darkness felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. but what now if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end that was something that gregor did not want to think about too much so he started to move about crawling up and down the room.  once during that long evening the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door on the other side did the same it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. gregor went and waited immediately by the door resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was but the door was opened no more that night and gregor waited in vain. the previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him but now now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day noone came and the keys were in the other sides.  it was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tiptoe. it was clear that noone would come into gregors room any more until morning that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to rearrange his life. for some reason the tall empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor even though he had been living in it for five years. hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame he hurried under the couch. it pressed down on his back a little and he was no longer able to lift his head but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.  he spent the whole night there. some of the time he passed in a light sleep although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which however always led to the same conclusion for the time being he must remain calm he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he in his present condition was forced to impose on them.  gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions as early the next morning almost before the night had ended his sister nearly fully dressed opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. she did not see him straight away but when she did notice him under the couchhe had to be somewhere for gods sake he couldnt have flown awayshe was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. but she seemed to regret her behaviour as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tiptoe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. gregor had pushed his head forward right to the edge of the couch and watched her. would she notice that he had left the milk as it was realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable if she didnt do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch throw himself at his sisters feet and beg her for something good to eat. however his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. she immediately picked it upusing a rag not her bare handsand carried it out. gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place imagining the wildest possibilities but he never could have guessed what his sister in her goodness actually did bring. in order to test his taste she brought him a whole selection of things all spread out on an old newspaper. there were old halfrotten vegetables bones from the evening meal covered in white sauce that had gone hard a few raisins and almonds some cheese that gregor had declared inedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. as well as all that she had poured some water into the dish which had probably been permanently set aside for gregors use and placed it beside them. then out of consideration for gregors feelings as she knew that he would not eat in front of her she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. gregors little legs whirred at last he could eat. whats more his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving. this amazed him as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. am i less sensitive than i used to be then he thought and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately almost compellingly attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. quickly one after another his eyes watering with pleasure he consumed the cheese the vegetables and the sauce the fresh foods on the other hand he didnt like at all and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldnt stand the smell. long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. he was immediately startled although he had been half asleep and he hurried back under the couch. but he needed great selfcontrol to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space. half suffocating he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the leftovers mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more. she quickly dropped it all into a bin closed it with its wooden lid and carried everything out. she had hardly turned her back before gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.  this was how gregor received his food each day now once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well and gregors sister would send the maid away on some errand. gregors father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.  it was impossible for gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. as nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. it was only later when she had become a little more used to everythingthere was of course no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situationthat gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. hes enjoyed his dinner today she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him or if he left most of it which slowly became more and more frequent she would often say sadly now everythings just been left there again.  although gregor wasnt able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it. there was seldom any conversation especially at first that was not about him in some way even if only in secret. for two whole days all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at homenobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. and on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged gregors mother to let her go without delay. it was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour tearfully thanking gregors mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. she even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened even though noone had asked that of her.  now gregors sister also had to help his mother with the cooking although that was not so much bother as noone ate very much. gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat and receive no more answer than no thanks ive had enough or something similar. noone drank very much either. his sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. when his father then said nothing she would add so that he would not feel selfish that she could send the housekeeper for it but then his father would close the matter with a big loud no and no more would be said.  even before the first day had come to an end his father had explained to gregors mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. what he heard his father say was some of the first good news that gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. he had thought that nothing at all remained from his fathers business at least he had never told him anything different and gregor had never asked him about it anyway. their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair and gregors only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. so then he started working especially hard with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. they had been good times and they had never come again at least not with the same splendour even though gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family and did bear them. they had even got used to it both gregor and the family they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. gregor only remained close to his sister now. unlike him she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. during gregors short periods in town conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk but gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on christmas day.  that was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state pressed upright against the door and listening. there were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent. whats that hes doing now his father would say after a while clearly having gone over to the door and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.  when explaining things his father repeated himself several times partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because gregors mother did not understand everything the first time. from these repeated explanations gregor learned to his pleasure that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. it was not a lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. besides that they had not been using up all the money that gregor had been bringing home every month keeping only a little for himself so that that too had been accumulating. behind the door gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. he could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.  this money however was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest it was enough to maintain them for perhaps one or two years no more. thats to say it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies money to live on had to be earned. his father was healthy but old and lacking in self confidence. during the five years that he had not been workingthe first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no successhe had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. would gregors elderly mother now have to go and earn money she suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. would his sister have to go and earn money she was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting of wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool leather sofa next to it as he became quite hot with shame and regret.  he would often lie there the whole night through not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window climbing up onto the sill and propped up in the chair leaning on the window to stare out of it. he had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day even things that were quite near he had used to curse the everpresent view of the hospital across the street but now he could not see it at all and if he had not known that he lived in charlottenstrasse which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. his observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.  if gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it but as it was it caused him pain. his sister naturally tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it and the longer it went on of course the better she was able to do so but as time went by gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. it had even become very unpleasant for him now whenever she entered the room. no sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that noone would have to suffer the view into gregors room then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. even if it was cold she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. she would alarm gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.  one day about a month after gregors transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window motionless and just where he would be most horrible. in itself his sisters not coming into the room would have been no surprise for gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there but not only did she not come in she went straight back and closed the door behind her a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of course but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual. it made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. one day in order to spare her even this sight he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. if she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for gregor to cut himself off so completely. she left the sheet where it was. gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.  for the first fourteen days gregors parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. he would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though before they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. but now the two of them father and mother would often both wait outside the door of gregors room while his sister tidied up in there and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked what gregor had eaten how he had behaved this time and whether perhaps any slight improvement could be seen. his mother also wanted to go in and visit gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. gregor listened very closely to all this and approved fully. later though she had to be held back by force which made her call out let me go and see gregor he is my unfortunate son cant you understand i have to see him and gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in not every day of course but one day a week perhaps she could understand everything much better than his sister who for all her courage was still just a child after all and really might not have had an adults appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.  gregors wish to see his mother was soon realised. out of consideration for his parents gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just lie quietly through the night his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. he was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling it was quite different from lying on the floor he could breathe more freely his body had a light swing to it and up there relaxed and almost happy it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. but now of course he had far better control of his body than before and even with a fall as great as that caused himself no damage. very soon his sister noticed gregors new way of entertaining himselfhe had after all left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled aboutand got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way especially the chest of drawers and the desk. now this was not something that she would be able to do by herself she did not dare to ask for help from her father the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when gregors father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. as she approached the room gregor could hear his mother express her joy but once at the door she went silent. first of course his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright and only then did she let her mother enter. gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. gregor also refrained this time from spying out from under the sheet he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. you can come in he cant be seen said his sister obviously leading her in by the hand. the old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about but gregor listened as they pushed it from its place his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mothers warnings that she would strain herself. this lasted a very long time. after labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before gregors father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more and for another thing it wasnt even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. she thought just the opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart and why wouldnt gregor feel the same way about it hed been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. then quietly almost whispering as if wanting gregor whose whereabouts she did not know to hear not even the tone of her voice as she was convinced that he did not understand her words she added and by taking the furniture away wont it seem like were showing that weve given up all hope of improvement and were abandoning him to cope for himself i think itd be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when gregor comes back to us again hell find everything unchanged and hell be able to forget the time in between all the easier.  hearing these words from his mother made gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months must have made him confusedhe could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited that would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. he had come very close to forgetting and it had only been the voice of his mother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it. nothing should be removed everything had to stay he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.  his sister unfortunately did not agree she had become used to the idea not without reason that she was gregors spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. this meant that his mothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch. it was more than childish perversity of course or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired that made her insist she had indeed noticed that gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in whereas the furniture as far as anyone could see was of no use to him at all. girls of that age though do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. perhaps this was what tempted grete to make gregors situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him. grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.  so she refused to let her mother dissuade her. gregors mother already looked uneasy in his room she soon stopped speaking and helped gregors sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. the chest of drawers was something that gregor could do without if he had to but the writing desk had to stay. hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers groaning out of the room than gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it. he meant to be as careful and considerate as he could but unfortunately it was his mother who came back first while grete in the next room had her arms round the chest pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without of course moving it an inch. his mother was not used to the sight of gregor he might have made her ill so gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. in his startlement though he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. it was enough to attract his mothers attention. she stood very still remained there a moment and then went back out to grete.  gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro their little calls to each other the scraping of the furniture on the floor all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides. with his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer. they were emptying his room out taking away everything that was dear to him they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee at high school even while he had been at infant schoolhe really could not wait any longer to see whether the two womens intentions were good. he had nearly forgotten they were there anyway as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.  so while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath he sallied out changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wallwhich was already denuded of everything else that had been on itof the lady dressed in copious fur. he hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. this picture at least now totally covered by gregor would certainly be taken away by noone. he turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.  they had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. what shall we take now then said grete and looked around. her eyes met those of gregor on the wall. perhaps only because her mother was there she remained calm bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice come on lets go back in the living room for a while gregor could see what grete had in mind she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. well she could certainly try it he sat unyielding on his picture. he would rather jump at gretes face.  but gretes words had made her mother quite worried she stepped to one side saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper and before she even realised it was gregor that she saw screamed oh god oh god arms outstretched she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. gregor shouted his sister glowering at him and shaking her fist. that was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. she ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint gregor wanted to help toohe could save his picture later although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force then he too ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing she was looking into various bottles he startled her when she turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut gregors face some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him now without delaying any longer grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother she slammed the door shut with her foot. so now gregor was shut out from his mother who because of him might be near to death he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away and she had to stay with his mother there was nothing for him to do but wait and oppressed with anxiety and selfreproach he began to crawl about he crawled over everything walls furniture ceiling and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.  he lay there for a while numb and immobile all around him it was quiet maybe that was a good sign. then there was someone at the door. the maid of course had locked herself in her kitchen so that grete would have to go and answer it. his father had arrived home. whats happened were his first words gretes appearance must have made everything clear to him. she answered him with subdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest mothers fainted but shes better now. gregor got out. just as i expected said his father just as i always said but you women wouldnt listen would you. it was clear to gregor that grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened that he was responsible for some act of violence. that meant gregor would now have to try to calm his father as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. so he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father when he came in from the hall could see straight away that gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.  his father though was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that ah he shouted as he came in sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time. gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. he really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now of late with his new habit of crawling about he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. he really ought to have expected things to have changed but still still was that really his father the same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when gregor came back from his business trips who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings who was hardly even able to stand up but as a sign of his pleasure would just raise his arms and who on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between gregor and his mother would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them who were already walking slowly for his sake who would place his stick down carefully and if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. he was standing up straight enough now dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high stiff collar of the coat his strong doublechin emerged under the bushy eyebrows his piercing dark eyes looked out fresh and alert his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. he took his cap with its gold monogram from probably some bank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa put his hands in his trouser pockets pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat and with look of determination walked towards gregor. he probably did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots but wasted no time with thathe knew full well right from the first day of his new life that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. and so he ran up to his father stopped when his father stopped scurried forwards again when he moved even slightly. in this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. gregor remained all this time on the floor largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. whatever he did gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. he became noticeably short of breath even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. now as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although here they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusionsthen right beside him lightly tossed something flew down and rolled in front of him. it was an apple then another one immediately flew at him gregor froze in shock there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him. he had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now without even taking the time for careful aim threw one apple after another. these little red apples rolled about on the floor knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. an apple thrown without much force glanced against gregors back and slid off without doing any harm. another one however immediately following it hit squarely and lodged in his back gregor wanted to drag himself away as if he could remove the surprising the incredible pain by changing his position but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out all his senses in confusion. the last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open his sister was screaming his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe she ran to his father her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father her arms around him uniting herself with him totallynow gregor lost his ability to see anythingher hands behind his fathers head begging him to spare gregors life.     iii   noone dared to remove the apple lodged in gregors flesh so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. he had suffered it there for more than a month and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that gregor despite his current sad and revolting form was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. on the contrary as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient just to be patient.  because of his injuries gregor had lost much of his mobilityprobably permanently. he had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long long minutes to crawl across his roomcrawling over the ceiling was out of the questionbut this deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. he got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversationwith everyones permission in a way and thus quite differently from before.  they no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times of course the ones that gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. all of them were usually very quiet nowadays. soon after dinner his father would go to sleep in his chair his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet his mother bent deeply under the lamp would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop his sister who had taken a sales job learned shorthand and french in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on. sometimes his father would wake up and say to gregors mother youre doing so much sewing again today as if he did not know that he had been dozingand then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.  with a kind of stubbornness gregors father refused to take his uniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unused on its peg gregors father would slumber where he was fully dressed as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. the uniform had not been new to start with but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of gregors mother and sister to look after it. gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny while the old man in it would sleep highly uncomfortable but peaceful.  as soon as it struck ten gregors mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed as he couldnt sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. but since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. then however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. gregors mother would tug at his sleeve whisper endearments into his ear gregors sister would leave her work to help her mother but nothing would have any effect on him. he would just sink deeper into his chair. only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes look at them one after the other and say what a life this is what peace i get in my old age and supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself let the women take him to the door send them off and carry on by himself while gregors mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.  who in this tired and overworked family would have had time to give more attention to gregor than was absolutely necessary the household budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed an enormous thickboned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work everything else was looked after by gregors mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. gregor even learned listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. but the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances they could not move out of it there was no imaginable way of transferring gregor to the new address. he could see quite well though that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. they carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people gregors father brought bank employees their breakfast his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers but they just did not have the strength to do any more. and the injury in gregors back began to hurt as much as when it was new. after they had come back from taking his father to bed gregors mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together cheek to cheek his mother would point to gregors room and say close that door grete and then when he was in the dark again they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle or they would simply sit there staring dryeyed at the table.  gregor hardly slept at all either night or day. sometimes he would think of taking over the familys affairs just like before the next time the door was opened he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk but they would appear again in his thoughts the salesmen and the apprentices that stupid teaboy two or three friends from other businesses one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slowall of them appeared to him mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible and he was glad when they disappeared. other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to even if he was not hungry. gregors sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom indifferent as to whether it had been eaten ormore often than nothad been left totally untouched. she still cleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have been any quicker about it. smears of dirt were left on the walls here and there were little balls of dust and filth. at first gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. at the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understoodcleaning up gregors room was for her and her alone. gregors mother did once thoroughly clean his room and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do italthough that much dampness also made gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch bitter and immobile. but his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in gregors room and highly aggrieved ran back into the living room where despite her mothers raised and imploring hands she broke into convulsive tears. her father of course was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless then they too became agitated gregors father standing to the right of his mother accused her of not leaving the cleaning of gregors room to his sister from her left gregors sister screamed at her that she was never to clean gregors room again while his mother tried to draw his father who was beside himself with anger into the bedroom his sister quaking with tears thumped on the table with her small fists and gregor hissed in anger that noone had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.  gregors sister was exhausted from going out to work and looking after gregor as she had done before was even more work for her but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. gregor on the other hand ought not to be neglected. now though the charwoman was here. this elderly widow with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life wasnt really repelled by gregor. just by chance one day rather than any real curiosity she opened the door to gregors room and found herself face to face with him. he was taken totally by surprise noone was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. from then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. at first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly such as come on then you old dungbeetle or look at the old dungbeetle there gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. if only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it one day early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes perhaps indicating that spring was coming she began to speak to him in that way once again. gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her he was slow and infirm but it was like a kind of attack. instead of being afraid the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into gregors back. arent you coming any closer then she asked when gregor turned round again and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.  gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it leave it there a few hours and then more often than not spit it out again. at first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating but he had soon got used to the changes made there. they had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. these earnest gentlemenall three of them had full beards as gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one daywere painfully insistent on things being tidy. this meant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room in this establishment in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate especially if it was dirty. they had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. for this reason many things had become superfluous which although they could not be sold the family did not wish to discard. all these things found their way into gregors room. the dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. the charwoman was always in a hurry and anything she couldnt use for the time being she would just chuck in there. he fortunately would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. the woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity or to throw everything out in one go but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. at first he moved it because with no other room free where he could crawl about he was forced to but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.  the gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. but gregor found it easy to give up having the door open he had after all often failed to make use of it when it was open and without the family having noticed it lain in his room in its darkest corner. one time though the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. they sat up at the table where formerly gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. gregors mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. the food was steaming and filled the room with its smell. the gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it and the gentleman in the middle who seemed to count as an authority for the other two did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. it was to his satisfaction and gregors mother and sister who had been looking on anxiously began to breathe again and smiled.  the family themselves ate in the kitchen. nonetheless gregors father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. the gentlemen stood as one and mumbled something into their beards. then once they were alone they ate in near perfect silence. it seemed remarkable to gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard as if they had wanted to show gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. id like to eat something said gregor anxiously but not anything like theyre eating. they do feed themselves. and here i am dying  throughout all this time gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. the three gentlemen had already finished their meal the one in the middle had produced a newspaper given a page to each of the others and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. when the violin began playing they became attentive stood up and went on tiptoe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. someone must have heard them in the kitchen as gregors father called out is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen we can stop it straight away. on the contrary said the middle gentleman would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room where it is after all much more cosy and comfortable oh yes wed love to called back gregors father as if he had been the violin player himself. the gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. gregors father soon appeared with the music stand his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. she calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing his parents who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen did not even dare to sit on their own chairs his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat his mother though was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and satleaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed itout of the way in a corner.  his sister began to play father and mother paid close attention one on each side to the movements of her hands. drawn in by the playing gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. before he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. whats more there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement he carried threads hairs and remains of food about on his back and sides he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. and despite this condition he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.  noone noticed him though. the family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing at first the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played and they must have disturbed gregors sister but soon in contrast with the family they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume and they stayed by the window while gregors father observed them anxiously. it really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. it was especially unnerving the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. yet gregors sister was playing so beautifully. her face was leant to one side following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. gregor crawled a little further forward keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. was he an animal if music could captivate him so it seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. he was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin as noone appreciated her playing here as much as he would. he never wanted to let her out of his room not while he lived anyway his shocking appearance should for once be of some use to him he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers his sister should not be forced to stay with him though but stay of her own free will she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory how he would have told everyone about it last christmashad christmas really come and gone alreadyif this misfortune hadnt got in the way and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. on hearing all this his sister would break out in tears of emotion and gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck which since she had been going out to work she had kept free without any necklace or collar.  mr. samsa shouted the middle gentleman to gregors father pointing without wasting any more words with his forefinger at gregor as he slowly moved forward. the violin went silent the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends shaking his head and then looked back at gregor. his father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving gregor out even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. he rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of gregor with his body. now they did become a little annoyed and it was not clear whether it was his fathers behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like gregor in the next room without knowing it. they asked gregors father for explanations raised their arms like he had tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. meanwhile gregors sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. she had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing but then she suddenly pulled herself together lay the instrument on her mothers lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was and ran into the next room which under pressure from her father the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. under his sisters experienced hand the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. gregors father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. he urged them and pressed them until when he was already at the door of the room the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought gregors father to a halt. i declare here and now he said raising his hand and glancing at gregors mother and sister to gain their attention too that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this familyhere he looked briefly but decisively at the floori give immediate notice on my room. for the days that i have been living here i will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary i will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action. he was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. and indeed his two friends joined in with the words and we also give immediate notice. with that he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.  gregors father staggered back to his seat feeling his way with his hands and fell into it it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. throughout all this gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. his disappointment at the failure of his plan and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger made it impossible for him to move. he was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment and he waited. he was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mothers lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.  father mother said his sister hitting the table with her hand as introduction we cant carry on like this. maybe you cant see it but i can. i dont want to call this monster my brother all i can say is we have to try and get rid of it. weve done all thats humanly possible to look after it and be patient i dont think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.  shes absolutely right said gregors father to himself. his mother who still had not had time to catch her breath began to cough dully her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.  gregors sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. her words seemed to give gregors father some more definite ideas. he sat upright played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal and occasionally looked down at gregor as he lay there immobile.  we have to try and get rid of it said gregors sister now speaking only to her father as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen itll be the death of both of you i can see it coming. we cant all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this we cant endure it. i cant endure it any more. and she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.  my child said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding what are we to do  his sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her displacing her earlier certainty.  if he could just understand us said his father almost as a question his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.  if he could just understand us repeated gregors father closing his eyes in acceptance of his sisters certainty that that was quite impossible then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. but as it is ...  its got to go shouted his sister thats the only way father. youve got to get rid of the idea that thats gregor. weve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. how can that be gregor if it were gregor he would have seen long ago that its not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. we wouldnt have a brother any more then but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. as it is this animal is persecuting us its driven out our tenants it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. father look just look she suddenly screamed hes starting again in her alarm which was totally beyond gregors comprehension his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near gregor. she rushed over to behind her father who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of gregors sister as if to protect her.  but gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone least of all his sister. all he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room although that was in itself quite startling as his painwracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. he stopped and looked round. they seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. his mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.  maybe now theyll let me turn round thought gregor and went back to work. he could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. noone was making him rush any more everything was left up to him. as soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. he was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. he concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word not any cry from his family to distract him. he did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. he did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed only his sister had stood up. with his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.  he was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut bolted and locked. the sudden noise behind gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. it was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. she had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly gregor had not heard her coming at all and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents at last.  what now then gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness. he soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. this was no surprise to him it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. he also felt relatively comfortable. it is true that his entire body was aching but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. he could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it which was entirely covered in white dust. he thought back of his family with emotion and love. if it was possible he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. he remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. he watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. then without his willing it his head sank down completely and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.  when the cleaner came in early in the morningtheyd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did so that everyone in the flat knew when shed arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peaceshe made her usual brief look in on gregor and at first found nothing special. she thought he was laying there so still on purpose playing the martyr she attributed all possible understanding to him. she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand so she tried to tickle gregor with it from the doorway. when she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. she soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes wide whistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms come and ave a look at this its dead just lying there stone dead  mr. and mrs. samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. but then each from his own side they hurried out of bed. mr. samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders mrs. samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is how they went into gregors room. on the way they opened the door to the living room where grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. dead asked mrs. samsa looking at the charwoman enquiringly even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. thats what i said replied the cleaner and to prove it she gave gregors body another shove with the broom sending it sideways across the floor. mrs. samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom but did not complete it. now then said mr. samsa lets give thanks to god for that. he crossed himself and the three women followed his example. grete who had not taken her eyes from the corpse said just look how thin he was. he didnt eat anything for so long. the food came out again just the same as when it went in. gregors body was indeed completely dried up and flat they had not seen it until then but now he was not lifted up on his little legs nor did he do anything to make them look away.  grete come with us in here for a little while said mrs. samsa with a pained smile and grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. the cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. it was already the end of march after all.  the three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts they had been forgotten about. where is our breakfast the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. she just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into gregors room. they did so and stood around gregors corpse with their hands in the pockets of their wellworn coats. it was now quite light in the room.  then the door of the bedroom opened and mr. samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. all of them had been crying a little grete now and then pressed her face against her fathers arm.  leave my home. now said mr. samsa indicating the door and without letting the women from him. what do you mean asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted and he smiled sweetly. the other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. i mean just what i said answered mr. samsa and with his two companions went in a straight line towards the man. at first he stood there still looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. alright well go then he said and looked up at mr. samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from mr. samsa for his decision. mr. samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. at that and without delay the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that mr. samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. once there all three took their hats from the stand took their sticks from the holder bowed without a word and left the premises. mr. samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing but they had had no reason to mistrust the mens intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. as they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later the further down they went the more that the samsa family lost interest in them when a butchers boy proud of posture with his tray on his head passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were mr. samsa and the women came away from the landing and went as if relieved back into the flat.  they decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. so they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal mr. samsa to his employers mrs. samsa to her contractor and grete to her principal. the cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going shed finished her work for that morning. the three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. well asked mr. samsa. the charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. the almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat which had been a source of irritation to mr. samsa all the time she had been working for them swayed gently in all directions. what is it you want then asked mrs. samsa whom the cleaner had the most respect for. yes she answered and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away well then that thing in there you neednt worry about how youre going to get rid of it. thats all been sorted out. mrs. samsa and grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing mr. samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but with outstretched hand he made it quite clear that she was not to. so as she was prevented from telling them all about it she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and clearly peeved called out cheerio then everyone turned round sharply and left slamming the door terribly as she went.  tonight she gets sacked said mr. samsa but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. they got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. mr. samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. then he called out come here then. lets forget about all that old stuff shall we. come and give me a bit of attention. the two women immediately did as he said hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.  after that the three of them left the flat together which was something they had not done for months and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. they had the tram filled with warm sunshine all to themselves. leant back comfortably on their seats they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all baduntil then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. the greatest improvement for the time being of course would be achieved quite easily by moving house what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by gregor one that was in a better location and most of all more practical. all the time grete was becoming livelier. with all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale but while they were talking mr. and mrs. samsa were struck almost simultaneously with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. they became quieter. just from each others glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. and as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions as soon as they reached their destination grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.

wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct the other wayin short the period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only.  there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face on the throne of france. in both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes that things in general were settled for ever.  it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive. spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period as at this. mrs. southcott had recently attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthday of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of london and westminster. even the cocklane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years after rapping out its messages as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs. mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people from a congress of british subjects in america which strange to relate have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cocklane brood.  france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it. under the guidance of her christian pastors she entertained herself besides with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off his tongue torn out with pincers and his body burned alive because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of france and norway there were growing trees when that sufferer was put to death already marked by the woodman fate to come down and be sawn into boards to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it terrible in history. it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris there were sheltered from the weather that very day rude carts bespattered with rustic mire snuffed about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which the farmer death had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution. but that woodman and that farmer though they work unceasingly work silently and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous.  in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. daring burglaries by armed men and highway robberies took place in the capital itself every night families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers warehouses for security the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in the light and being recognised and challenged by his fellowtradesman whom he stopped in his character of the captain gallantly shot him through the head and rode away the mail was waylaid by seven robbers and the guard shot three dead and then got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in peace that magnificent potentate the lord mayor of london was made to stand and deliver on turnham green by one highwayman who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their turnkeys and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them loaded with rounds of shot and ball thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court drawingrooms musketeers went into st. giless to search for contraband goods and the mob fired on the musketeers and the musketeers fired on the mob and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. in the midst of them the hangman ever busy and ever worse than useless was in constant requisition now stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals now hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been taken on tuesday now burning people in the hand at newgate by the dozen and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall today taking the life of an atrocious murderer and tomorrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of sixpence.  all these things and a thousand like them came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive. environed by them while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded those two of the large jaws and those other two of the plain and the fair faces trod with stir enough and carried their divine rights with a high hand. thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive conduct their greatnesses and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them.     chapter ii. the mail   it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered up shooters hill. he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the least relish for walking exercise under the circumstances but because the hill and the harness and the mud and the mail were all so heavy that the horses had three times already come to a stop besides once drawing the coach across the road with the mutinous intent of taking it back to blackheath. reins and whip and coachman and guard however in combination had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animals are endued with reason and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.  with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way through the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. as often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand with a wary woho sohothen the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse denying that the coach could be got up the hill. whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind.  there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding none. a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coachlamps but these its own workings and a few yards of road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it as if they had made it all.  two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears and wore jackboots. not one of the three could have said from anything he saw what either of the other two was like and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind as from the eyes of the body of his two companions. in those days travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. as to the latter when every postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in the captains pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. so the guard of the dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters hill as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail beating his feet and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest before him where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horsepistols deposited on a substratum of cutlass.  the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers the passengers suspected one another and the guard they all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the journey.  woho said the coachman. so then one more pull and youre at the top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to get you to itjoe  halloa the guard replied.  what oclock do you make it joe  ten minutes good past eleven.  my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop of shooters yet tst yah get on with you  the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided negative made a decided scramble for it and the three other horses followed suit. once more the dover mail struggled on with the jackboots of its passengers squashing along by its side. they had stopped when the coach stopped and they kept close company with it. if any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.  the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. the horses stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent and open the coachdoor to let the passengers in.  tst joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down from his box.  what do you say tom  they both listened.  i say a horse at a canter coming up joe.  i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving his hold of the door and mounting nimbly to his place. gentlemen in the kings name all of you  with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and stood on the offensive.  the passenger booked by this history was on the coachstep getting in the two other passengers were close behind him and about to follow. he remained on the step half in the coach and half out of they remained in the road below him. they all looked from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the coachman and listened. the coachman looked back and the guard looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back without contradicting.  the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach added to the stillness of the night made it very quiet indeed. the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach as if it were in a state of agitation. the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard but at any rate the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath and holding the breath and having the pulses quickened by expectation.  the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.  soho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar. yo there stand i shall fire  the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail  never you mind what it is the guard retorted. what are you  is that the dover mail  why do you want to know  i want a passenger if it is.  what passenger  mr. jarvis lorry.  our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. the guard the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.  keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right in your lifetime. gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight.  what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly quavering speech. who wants me is it jerry  i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard to himself. hes hoarser than suits me is jerry.  yes mr. lorry.  what is the matter  a despatch sent after you from over yonder. t. and co.  i know this messenger guard said mr. lorry getting down into the roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach shut the door and pulled up the window. he may come close theres nothing wrong.  i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that said the guard in gruff soliloquy. hallo you  well and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before.  come on at a footpace dye mind me and if youve got holsters to that saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em. for im a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes the form of lead. so now lets look at you.  the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood. the rider stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed the passenger a small folded paper. the riders horse was blown and both horse and rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.  guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence.  the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman answered curtly sir.  there is nothing to apprehend. i belong to tellsons bank. you must know tellsons bank in london. i am going to paris on business. a crown to drink. i may read this  if so be as youre quick sir.  he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side and readfirst to himself and then aloud wait at dover for mamselle. its not long you see guard. jerry say that my answer was recalled to life.  jerry started in his saddle. thats a blazing strange answer too  said he at his hoarsest.  take that message back and they will know that i received this as well as if i wrote. make the best of your way. good night.  with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in not at all assisted by his fellowpassengers who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. with no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.  the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his armchest and having looked to the rest of its contents and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which there were a few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderbox. for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps had been blown and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had only to shut himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he were lucky in five minutes.  tom softly over the coach roof.  hallo joe.  did you hear the message  i did joe.  what did you make of it tom  nothing at all joe.  thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the same of it myself.  jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile not only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his face and shake the wet out of his hatbrim which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. after standing with the bridle over his heavilysplashed arm until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again he turned to walk down the hill.  after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust your forelegs till i get you on the level said this hoarse messenger glancing at his mare. recalled to life. thats a blazing strange message. much of that wouldnt do for you jerry i say jerry youd be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life was to come into fashion jerry     chapter iii. the night shadows   a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. a solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there is in some of its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it something of the awfulness even of death itself is referable to this. no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved and vainly hope in time to read it all. no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable water wherein as momentary lights glanced into it i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. it was appointed that the book should shut with a spring for ever and for ever when i had read but a page. it was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost when the light was playing on its surface and i stood in ignorance on the shore. my friend is dead my neighbour is dead my love the darling of my soul is dead it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality and which i shall carry in mine to my lifes end. in any of the burialplaces of this city through which i pass is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their innermost personality to me or than i am to them  as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king the first minister of state or the richest merchant in london. so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach they were mysteries to one another as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six or his own coach and sixty with the breadth of a county between him and the next.  the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at alehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. he had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface black with no depth in the colour or form and much too near togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something singly if they kept too far apart. they had a sinister expression under an old cockedhat like a threecornered spittoon and over a great muffler for the chin and throat which descended nearly to the wearers knees. when he stopped for drink he moved this muffler with his left hand only while he poured his liquor in with his right as soon as that was done he muffled again.  no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as he rode. it wouldnt do for you jerry. jerry you honest tradesman it wouldnt suit your line of business recalled bust me if i dont think hed been a drinking  his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain several times to take off his hat to scratch his head. except on the crown which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair standing jaggedly all over it and growing down hill almost to his broad blunt nose. it was so like smiths work so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair that the best of players at leapfrog might have declined him as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.  while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness. they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every shadow on the road.  what time the mailcoach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon its tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside. to whom likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.  tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail. as the bank passengerwith an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger and driving him into his corner whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in his place with halfshut eyes the little coachwindows and the coachlamp dimly gleaming through them and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger became the bank and did a great stroke of business. the rattle of the harness was the chink of money and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with all its foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time. then the strongrooms underground at tellsons with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle and found them safe and strong and sound and still just as he had last seen them.  but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was always with him there was another current of impression that never ceased to run all through the night. he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night did not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of fiveandforty by years and they differed principally in the passions they expressed and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. pride contempt defiance stubbornness submission lamentation succeeded one another so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous colour emaciated hands and figures. but the face was in the main one face and every head was prematurely white. a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre  buried how long  the answer was always the same almost eighteen years.  you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  long ago.  you know that you are recalled to life  they tell me so.  i hope you care to live  i cant say.  shall i show her to you will you come and see her  the answers to this question were various and contradictory. sometimes the broken reply was wait it would kill me if i saw her too soon.  sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears and then it was take me to her. sometimes it was staring and bewildered and then it was i dont know her. i dont understand.  after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig and dig dignow with a spade now with a great key now with his handsto dig this wretched creature out. got out at last with earth hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to dust. the passenger would then start to himself and lower the window to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.  yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the moving patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. the real bankinghouse by temple bar the real business of the past day the real strong rooms the real express sent after him and the real message returned would all be there. out of the midst of them the ghostly face would rise and he would accost it again.  buried how long  almost eighteen years.  i hope you care to live  i cant say.  digdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his arm securely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the two slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.  buried how long  almost eighteen years.  you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  long ago.  the words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that the shadows of the night were gone.  he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun. there was a ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppicewood in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. though the earth was cold and wet the sky was clear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful.  eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun. gracious creator of day to be buried alive for eighteen years     chapter iv. the preparation   when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the forenoon the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coachdoor as his custom was. he did it with some flourish of ceremony for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.  by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations. the mildewy inside of the coach with its damp and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its obscurity was rather like a larger dogkennel. mr. lorry the passenger shaking himself out of it in chains of straw a tangle of shaggy wrapper flapping hat and muddy legs was rather like a larger sort of dog.  there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer  yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon sir. bed sir  i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber.  and then breakfast sir yes sir. that way sir if you please. show concord gentlemans valise and hot water to concord. pull off gentlemans boots in concord. you will find a fine seacoal fire sir. fetch barber to concord. stir about there now for concord  the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. consequently another drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord and the coffeeroom when a gentleman of sixty formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well kept with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed along on his way to his breakfast.  the coffeeroom had no other occupant that forenoon than the gentleman in brown. his breakfasttable was drawn before the fire and as he sat with its light shining on him waiting for the meal he sat so still that he might have been sitting for his portrait.  very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. he had a good leg and was a little vain of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were of a fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were trim. he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very close to his head which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. a face habitually suppressed and quieted was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner in years gone by some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellsons bank. he had a healthy colour in his cheeks and his face though lined bore few traces of anxiety. but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellsons bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people and perhaps secondhand cares like secondhand clothes come easily off and on.  completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait mr. lorry dropped off to sleep. the arrival of his breakfast roused him and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it  i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time today. she may ask for mr. jarvis lorry or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellsons bank. please to let me know.  yes sir. tellsons bank in london sir  yes.  yes sir. we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris sir. a vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and companys house.  yes. we are quite a french house as well as an english one.  yes sir. not much in the habit of such travelling yourself i think sir  not of late years. it is fifteen years since wesince icame last from france.  indeed sir that was before my time here sir. before our peoples time here sir. the george was in other hands at that time sir.  i believe so.  but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson and company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen years ago  you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far from the truth.  indeed sir  rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward from the table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtower. according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.  when mr. lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll on the beach. the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself away from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a marine ostrich. the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it liked was destruction. it thundered at the town and thundered at the cliffs and brought the coast down madly. the air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. a little fishing was done in the port and a quantity of strolling about by night and looking seaward particularly at those times when the tide made and was near flood. small tradesmen who did no business whatever sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.  as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen became again charged with mist and vapour mr. lorrys thoughts seemed to cloud too. when it was dark and he sat before the coffeeroom fire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast his mind was busily digging digging digging in the live red coals.  a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. mr. lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street and rumbled into the innyard.  he set down his glass untouched. this is mamselle said he.  in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette had arrived from london and would be happy to see the gentleman from tellsons.  so soon  miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required none then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellsons immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience.  the gentleman from tellsons had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettes apartment. it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables. these had been oiled and oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if they were buried in deep graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.  the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr. lorry picking his way over the wellworn turkey carpet supposed miss manette to be for the moment in some adjacent room until having got past the two tall candles he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire a young lady of not more than seventeen in a ridingcloak and still holding her straw travellinghat by its ribbon in her hand. as his eyes rested on a short slight pretty figure a quantity of golden hair a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look and a forehead with a singular capacity remembering how young and smooth it was of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright fixed attention though it included all the four expressionsas his eyes rested on these things a sudden vivid likeness passed before him of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very channel one cold time when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. the likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pierglass behind her on the frame of which a hospital procession of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine genderand he made his formal bow to miss manette.  pray take a seat sir. in a very clear and pleasant young voice a little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed.  i kiss your hand miss said mr. lorry with the manners of an earlier date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat.  i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that some intelligenceor discovery  the word is not material miss either word will do.  respecting the small property of my poor father whom i never sawso long dead  mr. lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. as if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets  rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there to communicate with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched to paris for the purpose.  myself.  as i was prepared to hear sir.  she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. he made her another bow.  i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should go to france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself during the journey under that worthy gentlemans protection. the gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.  i was happy said mr. lorry to be entrusted with the charge. i shall be more happy to execute it.  sir i thank you indeed. i thank you very gratefully. it was told me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature. i have done my best to prepare myself and i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.  naturally said mr. lorry. yesi  after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears it is very difficult to begin.  he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance. the young forehead lifted itself into that singular expressionbut it was pretty and characteristic besides being singularand she raised her hand as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed some passing shadow.  are you quite a stranger to me sir  am i not mr. lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.  between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing. he watched her as she mused and the moment she raised her eyes again went on  in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than address you as a young english lady miss manette  if you please sir.  miss manette i am a man of business. i have a business charge to acquit myself of. in your reception of it dont heed me any more than if i was a speaking machinetruly i am not much else. i will with your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our customers.  story  he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when he added in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers. he was a french gentleman a scientific gentleman a man of great acquirementsa doctor.  not of beauvais  why yes of beauvais. like monsieur manette your father the gentleman was of beauvais. like monsieur manette your father the gentleman was of repute in paris. i had the honour of knowing him there. our relations were business relations but confidential. i was at that time in our french house and had beenoh twenty years.  at that timei may ask at what time sir  i speak miss of twenty years ago. he marriedan english ladyand i was one of the trustees. his affairs like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tellsons hands. in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. these are mere business relations miss there is no friendship in them no particular interest nothing like sentiment. i have passed from one to another in the course of my business life just as i pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day in short i have no feelings i am a mere machine. to go on  but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to thinkthe curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon himthat when i was left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father only two years it was you who brought me to england. i am almost sure it was you.  mr. lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. he then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding the chairback with his left hand and using his right by turns to rub his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.  miss manette it was i. and you will see how truly i spoke of myself just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the relations i hold with my fellowcreatures are mere business relations when you reflect that i have never seen you since. no you have been the ward of tellsons house since and i have been busy with the other business of tellsons house since. feelings i have no time for them no chance of them. i pass my whole life miss in turning an immense pecuniary mangle.  after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr. lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before and resumed his former attitude.  so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your regretted father. now comes the difference. if your father had not died when he diddont be frightened how you start  she did indeed start. and she caught his wrist with both her hands.  pray said mr. lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitationa matter of business. as i was saying  her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and began anew  as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had suddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though no art could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper across the water there for instance the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his wife had implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any tidings of him and all quite in vainthen the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor of beauvais.  i entreat you to tell me more sir.  i will. i am going to. you can bear it  i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.  you speak collectedly and youare collected. thats good though his manner was less satisfied than his words. a matter of business. regard it as a matter of businessbusiness that must be done. now if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage and spirit had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born  the little child was a daughter sir.  a daughter. aamatter of businessdont be distressed. miss if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of by rearing her in the belief that her father was deadno dont kneel in heavens name why should you kneel to me  for the truth. o dear good compassionate sir for the truth  aa matter of business. you confuse me and how can i transact business if i am confused let us be clearheaded. if you could kindly mention now for instance what nine times ninepence are or how many shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging. i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.  without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still when he had very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been that she communicated some reassurance to mr. jarvis lorry.  thats right thats right. courage business you have business before you useful business. miss manette your mother took this course with you. and when she diedi believe brokenheartedhaving never slackened her unavailing search for your father she left you at two years old to grow to be blooming beautiful and happy without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison or wasted there through many lingering years.  as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.  you know that your parents had no great possession and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. there has been no new discovery of money or of any other property but  he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped. the expression in the forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which was now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror.  but he has beenbeen found. he is alive. greatly changed it is too probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the best. still alive. your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris and we are going there i to identify him if i can you to restore him to life love duty rest comfort.  a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his. she said in a low distinct awestricken voice as if she were saying it in a dream  i am going to see his ghost it will be his ghostnot him  mr. lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. there there there see now see now the best and the worst are known to you now. you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dear side.  she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free i have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me  only one thing more said mr. lorry laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention he has been found under another name his own long forgotten or long concealed. it would be worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly held prisoner. it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries because it would be dangerous. better not to mention the subject anywhere or in any way and to remove himfor a while at all eventsout of france. even i safe as an englishman and even tellsons important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of the matter. i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. this is a secret service altogether. my credentials entries and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to life which may mean anything. but what is the matter she doesnt notice a word miss manette  perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair she sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open and fixed upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead. so close was her hold upon his arm that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.  a wildlooking woman whom even in his agitation mr. lorry observed to be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressed in some extraordinary tightfitting fashion and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good measure too or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in advance of the inn servants and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his chest and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.  i really think this must be a man was mr. lorrys breathless reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall.  why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn servants. why dont you go and fetch things instead of standing there staring at me i am not so much to look at am i why dont you go and fetch things ill let you know if you dont bring smellingsalts cold water and vinegar quick i will.  there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she softly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill and gentleness calling her my precious and my bird and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.  and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr. lorry couldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening her to death look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. do you call that being a banker  mr. lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know something not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.  i hope she will do well now said mr. lorry.  no thanks to you in brown if she does. my darling pretty  i hope said mr. lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility that you accompany miss manette to france  a likely thing too replied the strong woman. if it was ever intended that i should go across salt water do you suppose providence would have cast my lot in an island  this being another question hard to answer mr. jarvis lorry withdrew to consider it.     chapter v. the wineshop   a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street. the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had tumbled out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wineshop shattered like a walnutshell.  all the people within reach had suspended their business or their idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine. the rough irregular stones of the street pointing every way and designed one might have thought expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded each by its own jostling group or crowd according to its size. some men kneeled down made scoops of their two hands joined and sipped or tried to help women who bent over their shoulders to sip before the wine had all run out between their fingers. others men and women dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from womens heads which were squeezed dry into infants mouths others made small mudembankments to stem the wine as it ran others directed by lookerson up at high windows darted here and there to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions others devoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed pieces of the cask licking and even champing the moister winerotted fragments with eager relish. there was no drainage to carry off the wine and not only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up along with it that there might have been a scavenger in the street if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.  a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men women and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game lasted. there was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness. there was a special companionship in it an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one which led especially among the luckier or lighterhearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of healths shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing a dozen together. when the wine was gone and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by fingers these demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out. the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting set it in motion again the women who had left on a doorstep the little pot of hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes or in those of her child returned to it men with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous faces who had emerged into the winter light from cellars moved away to descend again and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.  the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilled. it had stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many wooden shoes. the hands of the man who sawed the wood left red marks on the billets and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth and one tall joker so besmirched his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wineleesblood.  the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the streetstones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.  and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was heavycold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in waiting on the saintly presencenobles of great power all of them but most especially the last. samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young shivered at every corner passed in and out at every doorway looked from every window fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. the mill which had worked them down was the mill that grinds young people old the children had ancient faces and grave voices and upon them and upon the grown faces and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh was the sigh hunger. it was prevalent everywhere. hunger was pushed out of the tall houses in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys and started up from the filthy street that had no offal among its refuse of anything to eat. hunger was the inscription on the bakers shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread at the sausageshop in every deaddog preparation that was offered for sale. hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops of oil.  its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. a narrow winding street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets diverging all peopled by rags and nightcaps and all smelling of rags and nightcaps and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. in the hunted air of the people there was yet some wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. depressed and slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wanting among them nor compressed lips white with what they suppressed nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallowsrope they mused about enduring or inflicting. the trade signs and they were almost as many as the shops were all grim illustrations of want. the butcher and the porkman painted up only the leanest scrags of meat the baker the coarsest of meagre loaves. the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wineshops croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer and were gloweringly confidential together. nothing was represented in a flourishing condition save tools and weapons but the cutlers knives and axes were sharp and bright the smiths hammers were heavy and the gunmakers stock was murderous. the crippling stones of the pavement with their many little reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but broke off abruptly at the doors. the kennel to make amends ran down the middle of the streetwhen it ran at all which was only after heavy rains and then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses. across the streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down and lighted and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead as if they were at sea. indeed they were at sea and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.  for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger so long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the darkness of their condition. but the time was not come yet and every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain for the birds fine of song and feather took no warning.  the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in its appearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stood outside it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. its not my affair said he with a final shrug of the shoulders. the people from the market did it. let them bring another.  there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke he called to him across the way  say then my gaspard what do you do there  the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often the way with his tribe. it missed its mark and completely failed as is often the way with his tribe too.  what now are you a subject for the mad hospital said the wineshop keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it. why do you write in the public streets is theretell me thouis there no other place to write such words in  in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally perhaps not upon the jokers heart. the joker rapped it with his own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand and held out. a joker of an extremely not to say wolfishly practical character he looked under those circumstances.  put it on put it on said the other. call wine wine and finish there. with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers dress such as it wasquite deliberately as having dirtied the hand on his account and then recrossed the road and entered the wineshop.  this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man of thirty and he should have been of a hot temperament for although it was a bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over his shoulder. his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisplycurling short dark hair. he was a dark man altogether with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. goodhumoured looking on the whole but implacablelooking too evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose a man not desirable to be met rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side for nothing would turn the man.  madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure of manner. there was a character about madame defarge from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. madame defarge being sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large earrings. her knitting was before her but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. thus engaged with her right elbow supported by her left hand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but coughed just one grain of cough. this in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.  the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in a corner. other company were there two playing cards two playing dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. as he passed behind the counter he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man.  what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieur defarge to himself i dont know you.  but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.  how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defarge. is all the spilt wine swallowed  every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge.  when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or of anything but black bread and death. is it not so jacques  it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned.  at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  the last of the three now said his say as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.  ah so much the worse a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques. am i right jacques  you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge.  this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows up and slightly rustled in her seat.  hold then true muttered her husband. gentlemenmy wife  the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three flourishes. she acknowledged their homage by bending her head and giving them a quick look. then she glanced in a casual manner round the wineshop took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit and became absorbed in it.  gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her good day. the chamber furnished bachelorfashion that you wished to see and were inquiring for when i stepped out is on the fifth floor. the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here pointing with his hand near to the window of my establishment. but now that i remember one of you has already been there and can show the way. gentlemen adieu  they paid for their wine and left the place. the eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word.  willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to the door.  their conference was very short but very decided. almost at the first word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive. it had not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out. the gentleman then beckoned to the young lady and they too went out. madame defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and saw nothing.  mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wineshop thus joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. it opened from a stinking little black courtyard and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses inhabited by a great number of people. in the gloomy tilepaved entry to the gloomy tilepaved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master and put her hand to his lips. it was a gentle action but not at all gently done a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. he had no goodhumour in his face nor any openness of aspect left but had become a secret angry dangerous man.  it is very high it is a little difficult. better to begin slowly.  thus monsieur defarge in a stern voice to mr. lorry as they began ascending the stairs.  is he alone the latter whispered.  alone god help him who should be with him said the other in the same low voice.  is he always alone then  yes.  of his own desire  of his own necessity. as he was when i first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if i would take him and at my peril be discreetas he was then so he is now.  he is greatly changed  changed  the keeper of the wineshop stopped to strike the wall with his hand and mutter a tremendous curse. no direct answer could have been half so forcible. mr. lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavier as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.  such a staircase with its accessories in the older and more crowded parts of paris would be bad enough now but at that time it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. the uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted the air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. through such an atmosphere by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison the way lay. yielding to his own disturbance of mind and to his young companions agitation which became greater every instant mr. jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest. each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted seemed to escape and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. through the rusted bars tastes rather than glimpses were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood and nothing within range nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notredame had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.  at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped for the third time. there was yet an upper staircase of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions to be ascended before the garret story was reached. the keeper of the wineshop always going a little in advance and always going on the side which mr. lorry took as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady turned himself about here and carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder took out a key.  the door is locked then my friend said mr. lorry surprised.  ay. yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge.  you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired  i think it necessary to turn the key. monsieur defarge whispered it closer in his ear and frowned heavily.  why  why because he has lived so long locked up that he would be frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to i know not what harmif his door was left open.  is it possible exclaimed mr. lorry.  is it possible repeated defarge bitterly. yes. and a beautiful world we live in when it is possible and when many other such things are possible and not only possible but donedone see youunder that sky there every day. long live the devil. let us go on.  this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word of it had reached the young ladys ears. but by this time she trembled under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety and above all such dread and terror that mr. lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.  courage dear miss courage business the worst will be over in a moment it is but passing the roomdoor and the worst is over. then all the good you bring to him all the relief all the happiness you bring to him begin. let our good friend here assist you on that side. thats well friend defarge. come now. business business  they went up slowly and softly. the staircase was short and they were soon at the top. there as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at once in sight of three men whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged through some chinks or holes in the wall. on hearing footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wineshop.  i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieur defarge. leave us good boys we have business here.  the three glided by and went silently down.  there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of the wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alone mr. lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger  do you make a show of monsieur manette  i show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few.  is that well  i think it is well.  who are the few how do you choose them  i choose them as real men of my namejacques is my nameto whom the sight is likely to do good. enough you are english that is another thing. stay there if you please a little moment.  with an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in through the crevice in the wall. soon raising his head again he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there. with the same intention he drew the key across it three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned it as heavily as he could.  the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the room and said something. a faint voice answered something. little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.  he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter. mr. lorry got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held her for he felt that she was sinking.  aaabusiness business he urged with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. come in come in  i am afraid of it she answered shuddering.  of it what  i mean of him. of my father.  rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room. he sat her down just within the door and held her clinging to him.  defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside took out the key again and held it in his hand. all this he did methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. he stopped there and faced round.  the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim and dark for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any other door of french construction. to exclude the cold one half of this door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way. such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it was difficult on first coming in to see anything and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. yet work of that kind was being done in the garret for with his back towards the door and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at him a whitehaired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes.     chapter vi. the shoemaker   good day said monsieur defarge looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.  it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the salutation as if it were at a distance  good day  you are still hard at work i see  after a long silence the head was lifted for another moment and the voice replied yesi am working. this time a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again.  the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. it was not the faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. its deplorable peculiarity was that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. it was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. so entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. so sunken and suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground. so expressive it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.  some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood was not yet empty.  i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker to let in a little more light here. you can bear a little more  the shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listening at the floor on one side of him then similarly at the floor on the other side of him then upward at the speaker.  what did you say  you can bear a little more light  i must bear it if you let it in. laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.  the opened halfdoor was opened a little further and secured at that angle for the time. a broad ray of light fell into the garret and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his labour. his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. he had a white beard raggedly cut but not very long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes. the hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really otherwise but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so. his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body to be withered and worn. he and his old canvas frock and his loose stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchmentyellow that it would have been hard to say which was which.  he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones of it seemed transparent. so he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze pausing in his work. he never looked at the figure before him without first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spoke without first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak.  are you going to finish that pair of shoes today asked defarge motioning to mr. lorry to come forward.  what did you say  do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today  i cant say that i mean to. i suppose so. i dont know.  but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again.  mr. lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door. when he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker looked up. he showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it his lips and his nails were of the same pale leadcolour and then the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe. the look and the action had occupied but an instant.  you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge.  what did you say  here is a visitor.  the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his work.  come said defarge. here is monsieur who knows a wellmade shoe when he sees one. show him that shoe you are working at. take it monsieur.  mr. lorry took it in his hand.  tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name.  there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied  i forget what it was you asked me. what did you say  i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieurs information  it is a ladys shoe. it is a young ladys walkingshoe. it is in the present mode. i never saw the mode. i have had a pattern in my hand. he glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.  and the makers name said defarge.  now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and so on in regular changes without a moments intermission. the task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a fastdying man.  did you ask me for my name  assuredly i did.  one hundred and five north tower.  is that all  one hundred and five north tower.  with a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work again until the silence was again broken.  you are not a shoemaker by trade said mr. lorry looking steadfastly at him.  his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.  i am not a shoemaker by trade no i was not a shoemaker by trade. ii learnt it here. i taught myself. i asked leave to  he lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. his eyes came slowly back at last to the face from which they had wandered when they rested on it he started and resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a subject of last night.  i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficulty after a long while and i have made shoes ever since.  as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him mr. lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face  monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me  the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.  monsieur manette mr. lorry laid his hand upon defarges arm do you remember nothing of this man look at him. look at me. is there no old banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your mind monsieur manette  as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at mr. lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. they were overclouded again they were fainter they were gone but they had been there. and so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him but which were now extending towards him trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her.  darkness had fallen on him in its place. he looked at the two less and less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way. finally with a deep long sigh he took the shoe up and resumed his work.  have you recognised him monsieur asked defarge in a whisper.  yes for a moment. at first i thought it quite hopeless but i have unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew so well. hush let us draw further back. hush  she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on which he sat. there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.  not a word was spoken not a sound was made. she stood like a spirit beside him and he bent over his work.  it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand for his shoemakers knife. it lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood. he had taken it up and was stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. he raised them and saw her face. the two spectators started forward but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. she had no fear of his striking at her with the knife though they had.  he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began to form some words though no sound proceeded from them. by degrees in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say  what is this  with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her lips and kissed them to him then clasped them on her breast as if she laid his ruined head there.  you are not the gaolers daughter  she sighed no.  who are you  not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench beside him. he recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm. a strange thrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame he laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her.  her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed aside and fell down over her neck. advancing his hand by little and little he took it up and looked at it. in the midst of the action he went astray and with another deep sigh fell to work at his shoemaking.  but not for long. releasing his arm she laid her hand upon his shoulder. after looking doubtfully at it two or three times as if to be sure that it was really there he laid down his work put his hand to his neck and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it. he opened this carefully on his knee and it contained a very little quantity of hair not more than one or two long golden hairs which he had in some old day wound off upon his finger.  he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at it. it is the same. how can it be when was it how was it  as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too. he turned her full to the light and looked at her.  she had laid her head upon my shoulder that night when i was summoned outshe had a fear of my going though i had noneand when i was brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve. you will leave me them they can never help me to escape in the body though they may in the spirit. those were the words i said. i remember them very well.  he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. but when he did find spoken words for it they came to him coherently though slowly.  how was thiswas it you  once more the two spectators started as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness. but she sat perfectly still in his grasp and only said in a low voice i entreat you good gentlemen do not come near us do not speak do not move  hark he exclaimed. whose voice was that  his hands released her as he uttered this cry and went up to his white hair which they tore in a frenzy. it died out as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast but he still looked at her and gloomily shook his head.  no no no you are too young too blooming. it cant be. see what the prisoner is. these are not the hands she knew this is not the face she knew this is not a voice she ever heard. no no. she wasand he wasbefore the slow years of the north towerages ago. what is your name my gentle angel  hailing his softened tone and manner his daughter fell upon her knees before him with her appealing hands upon his breast.  o sir at another time you shall know my name and who my mother was and who my father and how i never knew their hard hard history. but i cannot tell you at this time and i cannot tell you here. all that i may tell you here and now is that i pray to you to touch me and to bless me. kiss me kiss me o my dear my dear  his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him.  if you hear in my voicei dont know that it is so but i hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears weep for it weep for it if you touch in touching my hair anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free weep for it weep for it if when i hint to you of a home that is before us where i will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service i bring back the remembrance of a home long desolate while your poor heart pined away weep for it weep for it  she held him closer round the neck and rocked him on her breast like a child.  if when i tell you dearest dear that your agony is over and that i have come here to take you from it and that we go to england to be at peace and at rest i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste and of our native france so wicked to you weep for it weep for it and if when i shall tell you of my name and of my father who is living and of my mother who is dead you learn that i have to kneel to my honoured father and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me weep for it weep for it weep for her then and for me good gentlemen thank god i feel his sacred tears upon my face and his sobs strike against my heart. o see thank god for us thank god  he had sunk in her arms and his face dropped on her breast a sight so touching yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it that the two beholders covered their faces.  when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all stormsemblem to humanity of the rest and silence into which the storm called life must hush at lastthey came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. he had gradually dropped to the floor and lay there in a lethargy worn out. she had nestled down with him that his head might lie upon her arm and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.  if without disturbing him she said raising her hand to mr. lorry as he stooped over them after repeated blowings of his nose all could be arranged for our leaving paris at once so that from the very door he could be taken away  but consider. is he fit for the journey asked mr. lorry.  more fit for that i think than to remain in this city so dreadful to him.  it is true said defarge who was kneeling to look on and hear. more than that monsieur manette is for all reasons best out of france. say shall i hire a carriage and posthorses  thats business said mr. lorry resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners and if business is to be done i had better do it.  then be so kind urged miss manette as to leave us here. you see how composed he has become and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. why should you be if you will lock the door to secure us from interruption i do not doubt that you will find him when you come back as quiet as you leave him. in any case i will take care of him until you return and then we will remove him straight.  both mr. lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course and in favour of one of them remaining. but as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to but travelling papers and as time pressed for the day was drawing to an end it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done and hurrying away to do it.  then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him. the darkness deepened and deepened and they both lay quiet until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.  mr. lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey and had brought with them besides travelling cloaks and wrappers bread and meat wine and hot coffee. monsieur defarge put this provender and the lamp he carried on the shoemakers bench there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed and he and mr. lorry roused the captive and assisted him to his feet.  no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind in the scared blank wonder of his face. whether he knew what had happened whether he recollected what they had said to him whether he knew that he was free were questions which no sagacity could have solved. they tried speaking to him but he was so confused and so very slow to answer that they took fright at his bewilderment and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. he had a wild lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands that had not been seen in him before yet he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughters voice and invariably turned to it when she spoke.  in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink and put on the cloak and other wrappings that they gave him to wear. he readily responded to his daughters drawing her arm through his and tookand kepther hand in both his own.  they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lamp mr. lorry closing the little procession. they had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped and stared at the roof and round at the walls.  you remember the place my father you remember coming up here  what did you say  but before she could repeat the question he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.  remember no i dont remember. it was so very long ago.  that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house was apparent to them. they heard him mutter one hundred and five north tower and when he looked about him it evidently was for the strong fortresswalls which had long encompassed him. on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread as being in expectation of a drawbridge and when there was no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street he dropped his daughters hand and clasped his head again.  no crowd was about the door no people were discernible at any of the many windows not even a chance passerby was in the street. an unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. only one soul was to be seen and that was madame defargewho leaned against the doorpost knitting and saw nothing.  the prisoner had got into a coach and his daughter had followed him when mr. lorrys feet were arrested on the step by his asking miserably for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. madame defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them and went knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard. she quickly brought them down and handed them inand immediately afterwards leaned against the doorpost knitting and saw nothing.  defarge got upon the box and gave the word to the barrier the postilion cracked his whip and they clattered away under the feeble overswinging lamps.  under the overswinging lampsswinging ever brighter in the better streets and ever dimmer in the worseand by lighted shops gay crowds illuminated coffeehouses and theatredoors to one of the city gates. soldiers with lanterns at the guardhouse there. your papers travellers see here then monsieur the officer said defarge getting down and taking him gravely apart these are the papers of monsieur inside with the white head. they were consigned to me with him at the he dropped his voice there was a flutter among the military lanterns and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform the eyes connected with the arm looked not an every day or an every night look at monsieur with the white head. it is well. forward from the uniform. adieu from defarge. and so under a short grove of feebler and feebler overswinging lamps out under the great grove of stars.  beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights some so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it as a point in space where anything is suffered or done the shadows of the night were broad and black. all through the cold and restless interval until dawn they once more whispered in the ears of mr. jarvis lorrysitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him and what were capable of restorationthe old inquiry  i hope you care to be recalled to life  and the old answer  i cant say.   the end of the first book.     book the secondthe golden thread     chapter i. five years later   tellsons bank by temple bar was an oldfashioned place even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. it was very small very dark very ugly very incommodious. it was an oldfashioned place moreover in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were proud of its smallness proud of its darkness proud of its ugliness proud of its incommodiousness. they were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars and were fired by an express conviction that if it were less objectionable it would be less respectable. this was no passive belief but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. tellsons they said wanted no elbowroom tellsons wanted no light tellsons wanted no embellishment. noakes and co.s might or snooks brothers might but tellsons thank heaven  any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding tellsons. in this respect the house was much on a par with the country which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable but were only the more respectable.  thus it had come to pass that tellsons was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat you fell into tellsons down two steps and came to your senses in a miserable little shop with two little counters where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows which were always under a showerbath of mud from fleetstreet and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper and the heavy shadow of temple bar. if your business necessitated your seeing the house you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back where you meditated on a misspent life until the house came with its hands in its pockets and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. your money came out of or went into wormy old wooden drawers particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. your banknotes had a musty odour as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. your deeds got into extemporised strongrooms made of kitchens and sculleries and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the bankinghouse air. your lighter boxes of family papers went upstairs into a barmecide room that always had a great diningtable in it and never had a dinner and where even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty the first letters written to you by your old love or by your little children were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows by the heads exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of abyssinia or ashantee.  but indeed at that time putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions and not least of all with tellsons. death is natures remedy for all things and why not legislations accordingly the forger was put to death the utterer of a bad note was put to death the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death the holder of a horse at tellsons door who made off with it was put to death the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death the sounders of threefourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime were put to death. not that it did the least good in the way of preventionit might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reversebut it cleared off as to this world the trouble of each particular case and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. thus tellsons in its day like greater places of business its contemporaries had taken so many lives that if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately disposed of they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had in a rather significant manner.  cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellsons the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. when they took a young man into tellsons london house they hid him somewhere till he was old. they kept him in a dark place like a cheese until he had the full tellson flavour and bluemould upon him. then only was he permitted to be seen spectacularly poring over large books and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.  outside tellsonsnever by any means in it unless called inwas an oddjobman an occasional porter and messenger who served as the live sign of the house. he was never absent during business hours unless upon an errand and then he was represented by his son a grisly urchin of twelve who was his express image. people understood that tellsons in a stately way tolerated the oddjobman. the house had always tolerated some person in that capacity and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. his surname was cruncher and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness in the easterly parish church of hounsditch he had received the added appellation of jerry.  the scene was mr. crunchers private lodging in hangingswordalley whitefriars the time halfpast seven of the clock on a windy march morning anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty. mr. cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes apparently under the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a popular game by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.  mr. crunchers apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood and were but two in number even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. but they were very decently kept. early as it was on the windy march morning the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast and the lumbering deal table a very clean white cloth was spread.  mr. cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane like a harlequin at home. at first he slept heavily but by degrees began to roll and surge in bed until he rose above the surface with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. at which juncture he exclaimed in a voice of dire exasperation  bust me if she aint at it agin  a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.  what said mr. cruncher looking out of bed for a boot. youre at it agin are you  after hailing the morn with this second salutation he threw a boot at the woman as a third. it was a very muddy boot and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with mr. crunchers domestic economy that whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.  what said mr. cruncher varying his apostrophe after missing his markwhat are you up to aggerawayter  i was only saying my prayers.  saying your prayers youre a nice woman what do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me  i was not praying against you i was praying for you.  you werent. and if you were i wont be took the liberty with. here your mothers a nice woman young jerry going a praying agin your fathers prosperity. youve got a dutiful mother you have my son. youve got a religious mother you have my boy going and flopping herself down and praying that the breadandbutter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.  master cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill and turning to his mother strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.  and what do you suppose you conceited female said mr. cruncher with unconscious inconsistency that the worth of your prayers may be name the price that you put your prayers at  they only come from the heart jerry. they are worth no more than that.  worth no more than that repeated mr. cruncher. they aint worth much then. whether or no i wont be prayed agin i tell you. i cant afford it. im not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking. if you must go flopping yourself down flop in favour of your husband and child and not in opposition to em. if i had had any but a unnatral wife and this poor boy had had any but a unnatral mother i might have made some money last week instead of being counterprayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. buuust me said mr. cruncher who all this time had been putting on his clothes if i aint what with piety and one blowed thing and another been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with young jerry dress yourself my boy and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then and if you see any signs of more flopping give me a call. for i tell you here he addressed his wife once more i wont be gone agin in this manner. i am as rickety as a hackneycoach im as sleepy as laudanum my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldnt know if it wasnt for the pain in em which was me and which somebody else yet im none the better for it in pocket and its my suspicion that youve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket and i wont put up with it aggerawayter and what do you say now  growling in addition such phrases as ah yes youre religious too. you wouldnt put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child would you not you and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation mr. cruncher betook himself to his bootcleaning and his general preparation for business. in the meantime his son whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes and whose young eyes stood close by one another as his fathers did kept the required watch upon his mother. he greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals by darting out of his sleeping closet where he made his toilet with a suppressed cry of you are going to flop mother. halloa father and after raising this fictitious alarm darting in again with an undutiful grin.  mr. crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. he resented mrs. crunchers saying grace with particular animosity.  now aggerawayter what are you up to at it again  his wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing.  dont do it said mr. crunches looking about as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wifes petitions. i aint a going to be blest out of house and home. i wont have my wittles blest off my table. keep still  exceedingly redeyed and grim as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn jerry cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it growling over it like any fourfooted inmate of a menagerie. towards nine oclock he smoothed his ruffled aspect and presenting as respectable and businesslike an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with issued forth to the occupation of the day.  it could scarcely be called a trade in spite of his favourite description of himself as a honest tradesman. his stock consisted of a wooden stool made out of a brokenbacked chair cut down which stool young jerry walking at his fathers side carried every morning to beneath the bankinghouse window that was nearest temple bar where with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the oddjobmans feet it formed the encampment for the day. on this post of his mr. cruncher was as well known to fleetstreet and the temple as the bar itselfand was almost as inlooking.  encamped at a quarter before nine in good time to touch his threecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellsons jerry took up his station on this windy march morning with young jerry standing by him when not engaged in making forays through the bar to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. father and son extremely like each other looking silently on at the morning traffic in fleetstreet with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance that the mature jerry bit and spat out straw while the twinkling eyes of the youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in fleetstreet.  the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellsons establishment was put through the door and the word was given  porter wanted  hooray father heres an early job to begin with  having thus given his parent god speed young jerry seated himself on the stool entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing and cogitated.  always rusty his fingers is always rusty muttered young jerry. where does my father get all that iron rust from he dont get no iron rust here     chapter ii. a sight   you know the old bailey well no doubt said one of the oldest of clerks to jerry the messenger.  yees sir returned jerry in something of a dogged manner. i do know the bailey.  just so. and you know mr. lorry.  i know mr. lorry sir much better than i know the bailey. much better said jerry not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question than i as a honest tradesman wish to know the bailey.  very well. find the door where the witnesses go in and show the doorkeeper this note for mr. lorry. he will then let you in.  into the court sir  into the court.  mr. crunchers eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another and to interchange the inquiry what do you think of this  am i to wait in the court sir he asked as the result of that conference.  i am going to tell you. the doorkeeper will pass the note to mr. lorry and do you make any gesture that will attract mr. lorrys attention and show him where you stand. then what you have to do is to remain there until he wants you.  is that all sir  thats all. he wishes to have a messenger at hand. this is to tell him you are there.  as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note mr. cruncher after surveying him in silence until he came to the blottingpaper stage remarked  i suppose theyll be trying forgeries this morning  treason  thats quartering said jerry. barbarous  it is the law remarked the ancient clerk turning his surprised spectacles upon him. it is the law.  its hard in the law to spile a man i think. its hard enough to kill him but its wery hard to spile him sir.  not at all retained the ancient clerk. speak well of the law. take care of your chest and voice my good friend and leave the law to take care of itself. i give you that advice.  its the damp sir what settles on my chest and voice said jerry. i leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.  well well said the old clerk we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. some of us have damp ways and some of us have dry ways. here is the letter. go along.  jerry took the letter and remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of you are a lean old one too made his bow informed his son in passing of his destination and went his way.  they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outside newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised and where dire diseases were bred that came into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulled him off the bench. it had more than once happened that the judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him. for the rest the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly innyard from which pale travellers set out continually in carts and coaches on a violent passage into the other world traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road and shaming few good citizens if any. so powerful is use and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. it was famous too for the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent also for the whippingpost another dear old institution very humanising and softening to behold in action also for extensive transactions in bloodmoney another fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under heaven. altogether the old bailey at that date was a choice illustration of the precept that whatever is is right an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy did it not include the troublesome consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong.  making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought and handed in his letter through a trap in it. for people then paid to see the play at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play in bedlamonly the former entertainment was much the dearer. therefore all the old bailey doors were well guardedexcept indeed the social doors by which the criminals got there and those were always left wide open.  after some delay and demur the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way and allowed mr. jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into court.  whats on he asked in a whisper of the man he found himself next to.  nothing yet.  whats coming on  the treason case.  the quartering one eh  ah returned the man with a relish hell be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged and then hell be taken down and sliced before his own face and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on and then his head will be chopped off and hell be cut into quarters. thats the sentence.  if hes found guilty you mean to say jerry added by way of proviso.  oh theyll find him guilty said the other. dont you be afraid of that.  mr. crunchers attention was here diverted to the doorkeeper whom he saw making his way to mr. lorry with the note in his hand. mr. lorry sat at a table among the gentlemen in wigs not far from a wigged gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundle of papers before him and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets whose whole attention when mr. cruncher looked at him then or afterwards seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand jerry attracted the notice of mr. lorry who had stood up to look for him and who quietly nodded and sat down again.  whats he got to do with the case asked the man he had spoken with.  blest if i know said jerry.  what have you got to do with it then if a person may inquire  blest if i know that either said jerry.  the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court stopped the dialogue. presently the dock became the central point of interest. two gaolers who had been standing there went out and the prisoner was brought in and put to the bar.  everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling stared at him. all the human breath in the place rolled at him like a sea or a wind or a fire. eager faces strained round pillars and corners to get a sight of him spectators in back rows stood up not to miss a hair of him people on the floor of the court laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them to help themselves at anybodys cost to a view of himstood atiptoe got upon ledges stood upon next to nothing to see every inch of him. conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall of newgate jerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer and gin and tea and coffee and what not that flowed at him and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.  the object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of about fiveandtwenty wellgrown and welllooking with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. his condition was that of a young gentleman. he was plainly dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which was long and dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck more to be out of his way than for ornament. as an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. he was otherwise quite selfpossessed bowed to the judge and stood quiet.  the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at was not a sort that elevated humanity. had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his fascination. the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled was the sight the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder yielded the sensation. whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest according to their several arts and powers of selfdeceit the interest was at the root of it ogreish.  silence in the court charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle and jangle for that he was a false traitor to our serene illustrious excellent and so forth prince our lord the king by reason of his having on divers occasions and by divers means and ways assisted lewis the french king in his wars against our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth that was to say by coming and going between the dominions of our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth and those of the said french lewis and wickedly falsely traitorously and otherwise eviladverbiously revealing to the said french lewis what forces our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth had in preparation to send to canada and north america. this much jerry with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it made out with huge satisfaction and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid and over and over again aforesaid charles darnay stood there before him upon his trial that the jury were swearing in and that mr. attorneygeneral was making ready to speak.  the accused who was and who knew he was being mentally hanged beheaded and quartered by everybody there neither flinched from the situation nor assumed any theatrical air in it. he was quiet and attentive watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him so composedly that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn. the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.  over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light down upon him. crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it and had passed from its surface and this earths together. haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections as the ocean is one day to give up its dead. some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved may have struck the prisoners mind. be that as it may a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face he looked up and when he saw the glass his face flushed and his right hand pushed the herbs away.  it happened that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. about on a level with his eyes there sat in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom his look immediately rested so immediately and so much to the changing of his aspect that all the eyes that were turned upon him turned to them.  the spectators saw in the two figures a young lady of little more than twenty and a gentleman who was evidently her father a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair and a certain indescribable intensity of face not of an active kind but pondering and selfcommuning. when this expression was upon him he looked as if he were old but when it was stirred and broken upas it was now in a moment on his speaking to his daughterhe became a handsome man not past the prime of life.  his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm as she sat by him and the other pressed upon it. she had drawn close to him in her dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner. her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. this had been so very noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shown that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her and the whisper went about who are they  jerry the messenger who had made his own observations in his own manner and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption stretched his neck to hear who they were. the crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back at last it got to jerry  witnesses.  for which side  against.  against what side  the prisoners.  the judge whose eyes had gone in the general direction recalled them leaned back in his seat and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand as mr. attorneygeneral rose to spin the rope grind the axe and hammer the nails into the scaffold.     chapter iii. a disappointment   mr. attorneygeneral had to inform the jury that the prisoner before them though young in years was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. that this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of today or of yesterday or even of last year or of the year before. that it was certain the prisoner had for longer than that been in the habit of passing and repassing between france and england on secret business of which he could give no honest account. that if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. that providence however had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach to ferret out the nature of the prisoners schemes and struck with horror to disclose them to his majestys chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council. that this patriot would be produced before them. that his position and attitude were on the whole sublime. that he had been the prisoners friend but at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom on the sacred altar of his country. that if statues were decreed in britain as in ancient greece and rome to public benefactors this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. that as they were not so decreed he probably would not have one. that virtue as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well knew the jury would have word for word at the tips of their tongues whereat the jurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages was in a manner contagious more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love of country. that the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the crown to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour had communicated itself to the prisoners servant and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his masters tabledrawers and pockets and secrete his papers. that he mr. attorneygeneral was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant but that in a general way he preferred him to his mr. attorneygenerals brothers and sisters and honoured him more than his mr. attorneygenerals father and mother. that he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. that the evidence of these two witnesses coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his majestys forces and of their disposition and preparation both by sea and land and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power. that these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoners handwriting but that it was all the same that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. that the proof would go back five years and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the british troops and the americans. that for these reasons the jury being a loyal jury as he knew they were and being a responsible jury as they knew they were must positively find the prisoner guilty and make an end of him whether they liked it or not. that they never could lay their heads upon their pillows that they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows that they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows in short that there never more could be for them or theirs any laying of heads upon pillows at all unless the prisoners head was taken off. that head mr. attorneygeneral concluded by demanding of them in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.  when the attorneygeneral ceased a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner in anticipation of what he was soon to become. when toned down again the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witnessbox.  mr. solicitorgeneral then following his leaders lead examined the patriot john barsad gentleman by name. the story of his pure soul was exactly what mr. attorneygeneral had described it to beperhaps if it had a fault a little too exactly. having released his noble bosom of its burden he would have modestly withdrawn himself but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him sitting not far from mr. lorry begged to ask him a few questions. the wigged gentleman sitting opposite still looking at the ceiling of the court.  had he ever been a spy himself no he scorned the base insinuation. what did he live upon his property. where was his property he didnt precisely remember where it was. what was it no business of anybodys. had he inherited it yes he had. from whom distant relation. very distant rather. ever been in prison certainly not. never in a debtors prison didnt see what that had to do with it. never in a debtors prisoncome once again. never yes. how many times two or three times. not five or six perhaps. of what profession gentleman. ever been kicked might have been. frequently no. ever kicked downstairs decidedly not once received a kick on the top of a staircase and fell downstairs of his own accord. kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault but it was not true. swear it was not true positively. ever live by cheating at play never. ever live by play not more than other gentlemen do. ever borrow money of the prisoner yes. ever pay him no. was not this intimacy with the prisoner in reality a very slight one forced upon the prisoner in coaches inns and packets no. sure he saw the prisoner with these lists certain. knew no more about the lists no. had not procured them himself for instance no. expect to get anything by this evidence no. not in regular government pay and employment to lay traps oh dear no. or to do anything oh dear no. swear that over and over again. no motives but motives of sheer patriotism none whatever.  the virtuous servant roger cly swore his way through the case at a great rate. he had taken service with the prisoner in good faith and simplicity four years ago. he had asked the prisoner aboard the calais packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner had engaged him. he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charitynever thought of such a thing. he began to have suspicions of the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soon afterwards. in arranging his clothes while travelling he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoners pockets over and over again. he had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoners desk. he had not put them there first. he had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen at calais and similar lists to french gentlemen both at calais and boulogne. he loved his country and couldnt bear it and had given information. he had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot he had been maligned respecting a mustardpot but it turned out to be only a plated one. he had known the last witness seven or eight years that was merely a coincidence. he didnt call it a particularly curious coincidence most coincidences were curious. neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. he was a true briton and hoped there were many like him.  the blueflies buzzed again and mr. attorneygeneral called mr. jarvis lorry.  mr. jarvis lorry are you a clerk in tellsons bank  i am.  on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive did business occasion you to travel between london and dover by the mail  it did.  were there any other passengers in the mail  two.  did they alight on the road in the course of the night  they did.  mr. lorry look upon the prisoner. was he one of those two passengers  i cannot undertake to say that he was.  does he resemble either of these two passengers  both were so wrapped up and the night was so dark and we were all so reserved that i cannot undertake to say even that.  mr. lorry look again upon the prisoner. supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them  no.  you will not swear mr. lorry that he was not one of them  no.  so at least you say he may have been one of them  yes. except that i remember them both to have beenlike myselftimorous of highwaymen and the prisoner has not a timorous air.  did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity mr. lorry  i certainly have seen that.  mr. lorry look once more upon the prisoner. have you seen him to your certain knowledge before  i have.  when  i was returning from france a few days afterwards and at calais the prisoner came on board the packetship in which i returned and made the voyage with me.  at what hour did he come on board  at a little after midnight.  in the dead of the night. was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour  he happened to be the only one.  never mind about happening mr. lorry. he was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night  he was.  were you travelling alone mr. lorry or with any companion  with two companions. a gentleman and lady. they are here.  they are here. had you any conversation with the prisoner  hardly any. the weather was stormy and the passage long and rough and i lay on a sofa almost from shore to shore.  miss manette  the young lady to whom all eyes had been turned before and were now turned again stood up where she had sat. her father rose with her and kept her hand drawn through his arm.  miss manette look upon the prisoner.  to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth and beauty was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd. standing as it were apart with her on the edge of his grave not all the staring curiosity that looked on could for the moment nerve him to remain quite still. his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart. the buzz of the great flies was loud again.  miss manette have you seen the prisoner before  yes sir.  where  on board of the packetship just now referred to sir and on the same occasion.  you are the young lady just now referred to  o most unhappily i am  the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the judge as he said something fiercely answer the questions put to you and make no remark upon them.  miss manette had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the channel  yes sir.  recall it.  in the midst of a profound stillness she faintly began when the gentleman came on board  do you mean the prisoner inquired the judge knitting his brows.  yes my lord.  then say the prisoner.  when the prisoner came on board he noticed that my father turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health. my father was so reduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air and i had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps and i sat on the deck at his side to take care of him. there were no other passengers that night but we four. the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weather better than i had done. i had not known how to do it well not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour. he did it for me. he expressed great gentleness and kindness for my fathers state and i am sure he felt it. that was the manner of our beginning to speak together.  let me interrupt you for a moment. had he come on board alone  no.  how many were with him  two french gentlemen.  had they conferred together  they had conferred together until the last moment when it was necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat.  had any papers been handed about among them similar to these lists  some papers had been handed about among them but i dont know what papers.  like these in shape and size  possibly but indeed i dont know although they stood whispering very near to me because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there it was a dull lamp and they spoke very low and i did not hear what they said and saw only that they looked at papers.  now to the prisoners conversation miss manette.  the prisoner was as open in his confidence with mewhich arose out of my helpless situationas he was kind and good and useful to my father. i hope bursting into tears i may not repay him by doing him harm today.  buzzing from the blueflies.  miss manette if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to givewhich you must giveand which you cannot escape from givingwith great unwillingness he is the only person present in that condition. please to go on.  he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name. he said that this business had within a few days taken him to france and might at intervals take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long time to come.  did he say anything about america miss manette be particular.  he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen and he said that so far as he could judge it was a wrong and foolish one on englands part. he added in a jesting way that perhaps george washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the third. but there was no harm in his way of saying this it was said laughingly and to beguile the time.  any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators. her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence and in the pauses when she stopped for the judge to write it down watched its effect upon the counsel for and against. among the lookerson there was the same expression in all quarters of the court insomuch that a great majority of the foreheads there might have been mirrors reflecting the witness when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about george washington.  mr. attorneygeneral now signified to my lord that he deemed it necessary as a matter of precaution and form to call the young ladys father doctor manette. who was called accordingly.  doctor manette look upon the prisoner. have you ever seen him before  once. when he called at my lodgings in london. some three years or three years and a half ago.  can you identify him as your fellowpassenger on board the packet or speak to his conversation with your daughter  sir i can do neither.  is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either  he answered in a low voice there is.  has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment without trial or even accusation in your native country doctor manette  he answered in a tone that went to every heart a long imprisonment.  were you newly released on the occasion in question  they tell me so.  have you no remembrance of the occasion  none. my mind is a blank from some timei cannot even say what timewhen i employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to the time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter here. she had become familiar to me when a gracious god restored my faculties but i am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar. i have no remembrance of the process.  mr. attorneygeneral sat down and the father and daughter sat down together.  a singular circumstance then arose in the case. the object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down with some fellowplotter untracked in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago and got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required in the coffeeroom of an hotel in that garrisonanddockyard town waiting for another person. the prisoners counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him. opening this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.  you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner  the witness was quite sure.  did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner  not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken.  look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the prisoner. how say you are they very like each other  allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought into comparison. my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became much more remarkable. my lord inquired of mr. stryver the prisoners counsel whether they were next to try mr. carton name of my learned friend for treason but mr. stryver replied to my lord no but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might happen twice whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so confident having seen it and more. the upshot of which was to smash this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.  mr. cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence. he had now to attend while mr. stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit of clothes showing them how the patriot barsad was a hired spy and traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed judaswhich he certainly did look rather like. how the virtuous servant cly was his friend and partner and was worthy to be how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family affairs in france he being of french extraction did require his making those passages across the channelthough what those affairs were a consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him even for his life to disclose. how the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown togetherwith the exception of that reference to george washington which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears and therefore mr. attorneygeneral had made the most of it how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the state trials of this country were full. but there my lord interposed with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions.  mr. stryver then called his few witnesses and mr. cruncher had next to attend while mr. attorneygeneral turned the whole suit of clothes mr. stryver had fitted on the jury inside out showing how barsad and cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the prisoner a hundred times worse. lastly came my lord himself turning the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner.  and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again.  mr. carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement. while his learned friend mr. stryver massing his papers before him whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury while all the spectators moved more or less and grouped themselves anew while even my lord himself arose from his seat and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish this one man sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the lookerson taking note of him now said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. mr. cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour and added id hold half a guinea that he dont get no lawwork to do. dont look like the sort of one to get any do he  yet this mr. carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in for now when miss manettes head dropped upon her fathers breast he was the first to see it and to say audibly officer look to that young lady. help the gentleman to take her out. dont you see she will fall  there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much sympathy with her father. it had evidently been a great distress to him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. he had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud ever since. as he passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a moment spoke through their foreman.  they were not agreed and wished to retire. my lord perhaps with george washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward and retired himself. the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. it began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. the spectators dropped off to get refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat down.  mr. lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out now reappeared and beckoned to jerry who in the slackened interest could easily get near him.  jerry if you wish to take something to eat you can. but keep in the way. you will be sure to hear when the jury come in. dont be a moment behind them for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank. you are the quickest messenger i know and will get to temple bar long before i can.  jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. mr. carton came up at the moment and touched mr. lorry on the arm.  how is the young lady  she is greatly distressed but her father is comforting her and she feels the better for being out of court.  ill tell the prisoner so. it wont do for a respectable bank gentleman like you to be seen speaking to him publicly you know.  mr. lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind and mr. carton made his way to the outside of the bar. the way out of court lay in that direction and jerry followed him all eyes ears and spikes.  mr. darnay  the prisoner came forward directly.  you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness miss manette. she will do very well. you have seen the worst of her agitation.  i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. could you tell her so for me with my fervent acknowledgments  yes i could. i will if you ask it.  mr. cartons manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. he stood half turned from the prisoner lounging with his elbow against the bar.  i do ask it. accept my cordial thanks.  what said carton still only half turned towards him do you expect mr. darnay  the worst.  its the wisest thing to expect and the likeliest. but i think their withdrawing is in your favour.  loitering on the way out of court not being allowed jerry heard no more but left themso like each other in feature so unlike each other in mannerstanding side by side both reflected in the glass above them.  an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thiefandrascal crowded passages below even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale. the hoarse messenger uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection had dropped into a doze when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court carried him along with them.  jerry jerry mr. lorry was already calling at the door when he got there.  here sir its a fight to get back again. here i am sir  mr. lorry handed him a paper through the throng. quick have you got it  yes sir.  hastily written on the paper was the word acquitted.  if you had sent the message recalled to life again muttered jerry as he turned i should have known what you meant this time.  he had no opportunity of saying or so much as thinking anything else until he was clear of the old bailey for the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blueflies were dispersing in search of other carrion.     chapter iv. congratulatory   from the dimlylighted passages of the court the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day was straining off when doctor manette lucie manette his daughter mr. lorry the solicitor for the defence and its counsel mr. stryver stood gathered round mr. charles darnayjust releasedcongratulating him on his escape from death.  it would have been difficult by a far brighter light to recognise in doctor manette intellectual of face and upright of bearing the shoemaker of the garret in paris. yet no one could have looked at him twice without looking again even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully without any apparent reason. while one external cause and that a reference to his long lingering agony would alwaysas on the trialevoke this condition from the depths of his soul it was also in its nature to arise of itself and to draw a gloom over him as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun when the substance was three hundred miles away.  only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his misery and to a present beyond his misery and the sound of her voice the light of her face the touch of her hand had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. not absolutely always for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed but they were few and slight and she believed them over.  mr. darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully and had turned to mr. stryver whom he warmly thanked. mr. stryver a man of little more than thirty but looking twenty years older than he was stout loud red bluff and free from any drawback of delicacy had a pushing way of shouldering himself morally and physically into companies and conversations that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.  he still had his wig and gown on and he said squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr. lorry clean out of the group i am glad to have brought you off with honour mr. darnay. it was an infamous prosecution grossly infamous but not the less likely to succeed on that account.  you have laid me under an obligation to you for lifein two senses  said his late client taking his hand.  i have done my best for you mr. darnay and my best is as good as another mans i believe.  it clearly being incumbent on some one to say much better mr. lorry said it perhaps not quite disinterestedly but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.  you think so said mr. stryver. well you have been present all day and you ought to know. you are a man of business too.  and as such quoth mr. lorry whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group just as he had previously shouldered him out of itas such i will appeal to doctor manette to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. miss lucie looks ill mr. darnay has had a terrible day we are worn out.  speak for yourself mr. lorry said stryver i have a nights work to do yet. speak for yourself.  i speak for myself answered mr. lorry and for mr. darnay and for miss lucie andmiss lucie do you not think i may speak for us all  he asked her the question pointedly and with a glance at her father.  his face had become frozen as it were in a very curious look at darnay an intent look deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust not even unmixed with fear. with this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.  my father said lucie softly laying her hand on his.  he slowly shook the shadow off and turned to her.  shall we go home my father  with a long breath he answered yes.  the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed under the impressionwhich he himself had originatedthat he would not be released that night. the lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle and the dismal place was deserted until tomorrow mornings interest of gallows pillory whippingpost and brandingiron should repeople it. walking between her father and mr. darnay lucie manette passed into the open air. a hackneycoach was called and the father and daughter departed in it.  mr. stryver had left them in the passages to shoulder his way back to the robingroom. another person who had not joined the group or interchanged a word with any one of them but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest had silently strolled out after the rest and had looked on until the coach drove away. he now stepped up to where mr. lorry and mr. darnay stood upon the pavement.  so mr. lorry men of business may speak to mr. darnay now  nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr. cartons part in the days proceedings nobody had known of it. he was unrobed and was none the better for it in appearance.  if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind when the business mind is divided between goodnatured impulse and business appearances you would be amused mr. darnay.  mr. lorry reddened and said warmly you have mentioned that before sir. we men of business who serve a house are not our own masters. we have to think of the house more than ourselves.  i know i know rejoined mr. carton carelessly. dont be nettled mr. lorry. you are as good as another i have no doubt better i dare say.  and indeed sir pursued mr. lorry not minding him i really dont know what you have to do with the matter. if youll excuse me as very much your elder for saying so i really dont know that it is your business.  business bless you i have no business said mr. carton.  it is a pity you have not sir.  i think so too.  if you had pursued mr. lorry perhaps you would attend to it.  lord love you noi shouldnt said mr. carton.  well sir cried mr. lorry thoroughly heated by his indifference business is a very good thing and a very respectable thing. and sir if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments mr. darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. mr. darnay good night god bless you sir i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.chair there  perhaps a little angry with himself as well as with the barrister mr. lorry bustled into the chair and was carried off to tellsons. carton who smelt of port wine and did not appear to be quite sober laughed then and turned to darnay  this is a strange chance that throws you and me together. this must be a strange night to you standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones  i hardly seem yet returned charles darnay to belong to this world again.  i dont wonder at it its not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. you speak faintly.  i begin to think i am faint.  then why the devil dont you dine i dined myself while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis or some other. let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.  drawing his arm through his own he took him down ludgatehill to fleetstreet and so up a covered way into a tavern. here they were shown into a little room where charles darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine while carton sat opposite to him at the same table with his separate bottle of port before him and his fully halfinsolent manner upon him.  do you feel yet that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again mr. darnay  i am frightfully confused regarding time and place but i am so far mended as to feel that.  it must be an immense satisfaction  he said it bitterly and filled up his glass again which was a large one.  as to me the greatest desire i have is to forget that i belong to it. it has no good in it for meexcept wine like thisnor i for it. so we are not much alike in that particular. indeed i begin to think we are not much alike in any particular you and i.  confused by the emotion of the day and feeling his being there with this double of coarse deportment to be like a dream charles darnay was at a loss how to answer finally answered not at all.  now your dinner is done carton presently said why dont you call a health mr. darnay why dont you give your toast  what health what toast  why its on the tip of your tongue. it ought to be it must be ill swear its there.  miss manette then  miss manette then  looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall where it shivered to pieces then rang the bell and ordered in another.  thats a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark mr. darnay  he said filling his new goblet.  a slight frown and a laconic yes were the answer.  thats a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by how does it feel is it worth being tried for ones life to be the object of such sympathy and compassion mr. darnay  again darnay answered not a word.  she was mightily pleased to have your message when i gave it her. not that she showed she was pleased but i suppose she was.  the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this disagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him in the strait of the day. he turned the dialogue to that point and thanked him for it.  i neither want any thanks nor merit any was the careless rejoinder. it was nothing to do in the first place and i dont know why i did it in the second. mr. darnay let me ask you a question.  willingly and a small return for your good offices.  do you think i particularly like you  really mr. carton returned the other oddly disconcerted i have not asked myself the question.  but ask yourself the question now.  you have acted as if you do but i dont think you do.  i dont think i do said carton. i begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.  nevertheless pursued darnay rising to ring the bell there is nothing in that i hope to prevent my calling the reckoning and our parting without illblood on either side.  carton rejoining nothing in life darnay rang. do you call the whole reckoning said carton. on his answering in the affirmative then bring me another pint of this same wine drawer and come and wake me at ten.  the bill being paid charles darnay rose and wished him good night. without returning the wish carton rose too with something of a threat of defiance in his manner and said a last word mr. darnay you think i am drunk  i think you have been drinking mr. carton.  think you know i have been drinking.  since i must say so i know it.  then you shall likewise know why. i am a disappointed drudge sir. i care for no man on earth and no man on earth cares for me.  much to be regretted. you might have used your talents better.  may be so mr. darnay may be not. dont let your sober face elate you however you dont know what it may come to. good night  when he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went to a glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely in it.  do you particularly like the man he muttered at his own image why should you particularly like a man who resembles you there is nothing in you to like you know that. ah confound you what a change you have made in yourself a good reason for taking to a man that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been change places with him and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was and commiserated by that agitated face as he was come on and have it out in plain words you hate the fellow.  he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation drank it all in a few minutes and fell asleep on his arms with his hair straggling over the table and a long windingsheet in the candle dripping down upon him.     chapter v. the jackal   those were drinking days and most men drank hard. so very great is the improvement time has brought about in such habits that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman would seem in these days a ridiculous exaggeration. the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities neither was mr. stryver already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice behind his compeers in this particular any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.  a favourite at the old bailey and eke at the sessions mr. stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite specially to their longing arms and shouldering itself towards the visage of the lord chief justice in the court of kings bench the florid countenance of mr. stryver might be daily seen bursting out of the bed of wigs like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions.  it had once been noted at the bar that while mr. stryver was a glib man and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments. but a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. the more business he got the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney carton he always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning.  sydney carton idlest and most unpromising of men was stryvers great ally. what the two drank together between hilary term and michaelmas might have floated a kings ship. stryver never had a case in hand anywhere but carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling of the court they went the same circuit and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night and carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings like a dissipated cat. at last it began to get about among such as were interested in the matter that although sydney carton would never be a lion he was an amazingly good jackal and that he rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity.  ten oclock sir said the man at the tavern whom he had charged to wake himten oclock sir.  whats the matter  ten oclock sir.  what do you mean ten oclock at night  yes sir. your honour told me to call you.  oh i remember. very well very well.  after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes he got up tossed his hat on and walked out. he turned into the temple and having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of kings benchwalk and paperbuildings turned into the stryver chambers.  the stryver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gone home and the stryver principal opened the door. he had his slippers on and a loose bedgown and his throat was bare for his greater ease. he had that rather wild strained seared marking about the eyes which may be observed in all free livers of his class from the portrait of jeffries downward and which can be traced under various disguises of art through the portraits of every drinking age.  you are a little late memory said stryver.  about the usual time it may be a quarter of an hour later.  they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers where there was a blazing fire. a kettle steamed upon the hob and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone with plenty of wine upon it and brandy and rum and sugar and lemons.  you have had your bottle i perceive sydney.  two tonight i think. i have been dining with the days client or seeing him dineits all one  that was a rare point sydney that you brought to bear upon the identification. how did you come by it when did it strike you  i thought he was rather a handsome fellow and i thought i should have been much the same sort of fellow if i had had any luck.  mr. stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.  you and your luck sydney get to work get to work.  sullenly enough the jackal loosened his dress went into an adjoining room and came back with a large jug of cold water a basin and a towel or two. steeping the towels in the water and partially wringing them out he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold sat down at the table and said now i am ready  not much boiling down to be done tonight memory said mr. stryver gaily as he looked among his papers.  how much  only two sets of them.  give me the worst first.  there they are sydney. fire away  the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinkingtable while the jackal sat at his own paperbestrewn table proper on the other side of it with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. both resorted to the drinkingtable without stint but each in a different way the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband looking at the fire or occasionally flirting with some lighter document the jackal with knitted brows and intent face so deep in his task that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glasswhich often groped about for a minute or more before it found the glass for his lips. two or three times the matter in hand became so knotty that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up and steep his towels anew. from these pilgrimages to the jug and basin he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.  at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion and proceeded to offer it to him. the lion took it with care and caution made his selections from it and his remarks upon it and the jackal assisted both. when the repast was fully discussed the lion put his hands in his waistband again and lay down to meditate. the jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle and a fresh application to his head and applied himself to the collection of a second meal this was administered to the lion in the same manner and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.  and now we have done sydney fill a bumper of punch said mr. stryver.  the jackal removed the towels from his head which had been steaming again shook himself yawned shivered and complied.  you were very sound sydney in the matter of those crown witnesses today. every question told.  i always am sound am i not  i dont gainsay it. what has roughened your temper put some punch to it and smooth it again.  with a deprecatory grunt the jackal again complied.  the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school said stryver nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past the old seesaw sydney. up one minute and down the next now in spirits and now in despondency  ah returned the other sighing yes the same sydney with the same luck. even then i did exercises for other boys and seldom did my own.  and why not  god knows. it was my way i suppose.  he sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him looking at the fire.  carton said his friend squaring himself at him with a bullying air as if the firegrate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it your way is and always was a lame way. you summon no energy and purpose. look at me.  oh botheration returned sydney with a lighter and more goodhumoured laugh dont you be moral  how have i done what i have done said stryver how do i do what i do  partly through paying me to help you i suppose. but its not worth your while to apostrophise me or the air about it what you want to do you do. you were always in the front rank and i was always behind.  i had to get into the front rank i was not born there was i  i was not present at the ceremony but my opinion is you were said carton. at this he laughed again and they both laughed.  before shrewsbury and at shrewsbury and ever since shrewsbury  pursued carton you have fallen into your rank and i have fallen into mine. even when we were fellowstudents in the studentquarter of paris picking up french and french law and other french crumbs that we didnt get much good of you were always somewhere and i was always nowhere.  and whose fault was that  upon my soul i am not sure that it was not yours. you were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing to that restless degree that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. its a gloomy thing however to talk about ones own past with the day breaking. turn me in some other direction before i go.  well then pledge me to the pretty witness said stryver holding up his glass. are you turned in a pleasant direction  apparently not for he became gloomy again.  pretty witness he muttered looking down into his glass. i have had enough of witnesses today and tonight whos your pretty witness  the picturesque doctors daughter miss manette.  she pretty  is she not  no.  why man alive she was the admiration of the whole court  rot the admiration of the whole court who made the old bailey a judge of beauty she was a goldenhaired doll  do you know sydney said mr. stryver looking at him with sharp eyes and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face do you know i rather thought at the time that you sympathised with the goldenhaired doll and were quick to see what happened to the goldenhaired doll  quick to see what happened if a girl doll or no doll swoons within a yard or two of a mans nose he can see it without a perspectiveglass. i pledge you but i deny the beauty. and now ill have no more drink ill get to bed.  when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle to light him down the stairs the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. when he got out of the house the air was cold and sad the dull sky overcast the river dark and dim the whole scene like a lifeless desert. and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast as if the desertsand had risen far away and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.  waste forces within him and a desert all around this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace and saw for a moment lying in the wilderness before him a mirage of honourable ambition selfdenial and perseverance. in the fair city of this vision there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening waters of hope that sparkled in his sight. a moment and it was gone. climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.  sadly sadly the sun rose it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions incapable of their directed exercise incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible of the blight on him and resigning himself to let it eat him away.     chapter vi. hundreds of people   the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet streetcorner not far from sohosquare. on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason and carried it as to the public interest and memory far out to sea mr. jarvis lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived on his way to dine with the doctor. after several relapses into businessabsorption mr. lorry had become the doctors friend and the quiet streetcorner was the sunny part of his life.  on this certain fine sunday mr. lorry walked towards soho early in the afternoon for three reasons of habit. firstly because on fine sundays he often walked out before dinner with the doctor and lucie secondly because on unfavourable sundays he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend talking reading looking out of window and generally getting through the day thirdly because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew how the ways of the doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.  a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not to be found in london. there was no way through it and the front windows of the doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. there were few buildings then north of the oxfordroad and foresttrees flourished and wild flowers grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanished fields. as a consequence country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement and there was many a good south wall not far off on which the peaches ripened in their season.  the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day but when the streets grew hot the corner was in shadow though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. it was a cool spot staid but cheerful a wonderful place for echoes and a very harbour from the raging streets.  there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage and there was. the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house where several callings purported to be pursued by day but whereof little was audible any day and which was shunned by all of them at night. in a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where a planetree rustled its green leaves churchorgans claimed to be made and silver to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hallas if he had beaten himself precious and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. very little of these trades or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live upstairs or of a dim coachtrimming maker asserted to have a countinghouse below was ever heard or seen. occasionally a stray workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered about there or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard or a thump from the golden giant. these however were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the planetree behind the house and the echoes in the corner before it had their own way from sunday morning unto saturday night.  doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation and its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him. his scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and he earned as much as he wanted.  these things were within mr. jarvis lorrys knowledge thoughts and notice when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner on the fine sunday afternoon.  doctor manette at home  expected home.  miss lucie at home  expected home.  miss pross at home  possibly at home but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of miss pross as to admission or denial of the fact.  as i am at home myself said mr. lorry ill go upstairs.  although the doctors daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics. simple as the furniture was it was set off by so many little adornments of no value but for their taste and fancy that its effect was delightful. the disposition of everything in the rooms from the largest object to the least the arrangement of colours the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles by delicate hands clear eyes and good sense were at once so pleasant in themselves and so expressive of their originator that as mr. lorry stood looking about him the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time whether he approved  there were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all mr. lorry smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him walked from one to another. the first was the best room and in it were lucies birds and flowers and books and desk and worktable and box of watercolours the second was the doctors consultingroom used also as the diningroom the third changingly speckled by the rustle of the planetree in the yard was the doctors bedroom and there in a corner stood the disused shoemakers bench and tray of tools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wineshop in the suburb of saint antoine in paris.  i wonder said mr. lorry pausing in his looking about that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him  and why wonder at that was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.  it proceeded from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover and had since improved.  i should have thought mr. lorry began.  pooh youd have thought said miss pross and mr. lorry left off.  how do you do inquired that lady thensharply and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice.  i am pretty well i thank you answered mr. lorry with meekness how are you  nothing to boast of said miss pross.  indeed  ah indeed said miss pross. i am very much put out about my ladybird.  indeed  for gracious sake say something else besides indeed or youll fidget me to death said miss pross whose character dissociated from stature was shortness.  really then said mr. lorry as an amendment.  really is bad enough returned miss pross but better. yes i am very much put out.  may i ask the cause  i dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird to come here looking after her said miss pross.  do dozens come for that purpose  hundreds said miss pross.  it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned she exaggerated it.  dear me said mr. lorry as the safest remark he could think of.  i have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me and paid me for it which she certainly should never have done you may take your affidavit if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothingsince she was ten years old. and its really very hard  said miss pross.  not seeing with precision what was very hard mr. lorry shook his head using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.  all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet are always turning up said miss pross. when you began it  i began it miss pross  didnt you who brought her father to life  oh if that was beginning it said mr. lorry.  it wasnt ending it i suppose i say when you began it it was hard enough not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette except that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is no imputation on him for it was not to be expected that anybody should be under any circumstances. but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have forgiven him to take ladybirds affections away from me.  mr. lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous but he also knew her by this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one of those unselfish creaturesfound only among womenwho will for pure love and admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost it to beauty that they never had to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives. he knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint he had such an exalted respect for it that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mindwe all make such arrangements more or lesshe stationed miss pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by nature and art who had balances at tellsons.  there never was nor will be but one man worthy of ladybird said miss pross and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made a mistake in life.  here again mr. lorrys inquiries into miss prosss personal history had established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed as a stake to speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore with no touch of compunction. miss prosss fidelity of belief in solomon deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious matter with mr. lorry and had its weight in his good opinion of her.  as we happen to be alone for the moment and are both people of business he said when they had got back to the drawingroom and had sat down there in friendly relations let me ask youdoes the doctor in talking with lucie never refer to the shoemaking time yet  never.  and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him  ah returned miss pross shaking her head. but i dont say he dont refer to it within himself.  do you believe that he thinks of it much  i do said miss pross.  do you imagine mr. lorry had begun when miss pross took him up short with  never imagine anything. have no imagination at all.  i stand corrected do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose sometimes  now and then said miss pross.  do you suppose mr. lorry went on with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye as it looked kindly at her that doctor manette has any theory of his own preserved through all those years relative to the cause of his being so oppressed perhaps even to the name of his oppressor  i dont suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me.  and that is  that she thinks he has.  now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because i am a mere dull man of business and you are a woman of business.  dull miss pross inquired with placidity.  rather wishing his modest adjective away mr. lorry replied no no no. surely not. to return to businessis it not remarkable that doctor manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is should never touch upon that question i will not say with me though he had business relations with me many years ago and we are now intimate i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached and who is so devotedly attached to him believe me miss pross i dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of zealous interest.  well to the best of my understanding and bads the best youll tell me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid of the whole subject.  afraid  its plain enough i should think why he may be. its a dreadful remembrance. besides that his loss of himself grew out of it. not knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never feel certain of not losing himself again. that alone wouldnt make the subject pleasant i should think.  it was a profounder remark than mr. lorry had looked for. true said he and fearful to reflect upon. yet a doubt lurks in my mind miss pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.  cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head. touch that string and he instantly changes for the worse. better leave it alone. in short must leave it alone like or no like. sometimes he gets up in the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking up and down walking up and down in his room. ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down walking up and down in his old prison. she hurries to him and they go on together walking up and down walking up and down until he is composed. but he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. in silence they go walking up and down together walking up and down together till her love and company have brought him to himself.  notwithstanding miss prosss denial of her own imagination there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to her possessing such a thing.  the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.  here they are said miss pross rising to break up the conference and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon  it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such a peculiar ear of a place that as mr. lorry stood at the open window looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied they would never approach. not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them.  miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. her darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against her taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own chamber and cried. the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would have had more if it were possible. mr. lorry was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home. but no hundreds of people came to see the sights and mr. lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss prosss prediction.  dinnertime and still no hundreds of people. in the arrangements of the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and always acquitted herself marvellously. her dinners of a very modest quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be better. miss prosss friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of impoverished french who tempted by shillings and halfcrowns would impart culinary mysteries to her. from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress or cinderellas godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she pleased.  on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower regions or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance. on this occasion miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too.  it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the planetree and they should sit there in the air. as everything turned upon her and revolved about her they went out under the planetree and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr. lorry. she had installed herself some time before as mr. lorrys cupbearer and while they sat under the planetree talking she kept his glass replenished. mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the planetree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.  still the hundreds of people did not present themselves. mr. darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the planetree but he was only one.  doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie. but miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and retired into the house. she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the jerks.  the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young. the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.  he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual vivacity. pray doctor manette said mr. darnay as they sat under the planetreeand he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand which happened to be the old buildings of londonhave you seen much of the tower  lucie and i have been there but only casually. we have seen enough of it to know that it teems with interest little more.  i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smile though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. they told me a curious thing when i was there.  what was that lucie asked.  in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which had been for many years built up and forgotten. every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisonersdates names complaints and prayers. upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to execution had cut as his last work three letters. they were done with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand. at first they were read as d. i. c. but on being more carefully examined the last letter was found to be g. there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been. at length it was suggested that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig. the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.  my father exclaimed lucie you are ill  he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head. his manner and his look quite terrified them all.  no my dear not ill. there are large drops of rain falling and they made me start. we had better go in.  he recovered himself almost instantly. rain was really falling in large drops and he showed the back of his hand with raindrops on it. but he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of and as they went into the house the business eye of mr. lorry either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned towards charles darnay the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house.  he recovered himself so quickly however that mr. lorry had doubts of his business eye. the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and that the rain had startled him.  teatime and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerks upon her and yet no hundreds of people. mr. carton had lounged in but he made only two.  the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and windows open they were overpowered by heat. when the teatable was done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the heavy twilight. lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton leaned against a window. the curtains were long and white and some of the thundergusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings.  the raindrops are still falling large heavy and few said doctor manette. it comes slowly.  it comes surely said carton.  they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do.  there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a footstep was there.  a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay when they had listened for a while.  is it not impressive mr. darnay asked lucie. sometimes i have sat here of an evening until i have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight when all is so black and solemn  let us shudder too. we may know what it is.  it will seem nothing to you. such whims are only impressive as we originate them i think they are not to be communicated. i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming byandbye into our lives.  there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so  sydney carton struck in in his moody way.  the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. the corner echoed and reechoed with the tread of feet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight.  are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us miss manette or are we to divide them among us  i dont know mr. darnay i told you it was a foolish fancy but you asked for it. when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life and my fathers.  i take them into mine said carton. i ask no questions and make no stipulations. there is a great crowd bearing down upon us miss manette and i see themby the lightning. he added the last words after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.  and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder. here they come fast fierce and furious  it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him for no voice could be heard in it. a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moments interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at midnight.  the great bell of saint pauls was striking one in the cleared air when mr. lorry escorted by jerry highbooted and bearing a lantern set forth on his returnpassage to clerkenwell. there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mr. lorry mindful of footpads always retained jerry for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.  what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr. lorry to bring the dead out of their graves.  i never see the night myself masternor yet i dont expect towhat would do that answered jerry.  good night mr. carton said the man of business. good night mr. darnay. shall we ever see such a night again together  perhaps. perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too.     chapter vii. monseigneur in town   monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris. monseigneur was in his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his mornings chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the cook.  yes. it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneurs lips. one lacquey carried the chocolatepot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out. it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens. deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two.  monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented. monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company. so polite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france. a happy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countries similarly favouredalways was for england by way of example in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it.  monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket. of his pleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world was made for them. the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur.  yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmergeneral. as to finances public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances private because farmergenerals were rich and monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor. hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmergeneral poor in family. which farmergeneral carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before by mankindalways excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.  a sumptuous man was the farmergeneral. thirty horses stood in his stables twentyfour male domestics sat in his halls six bodywomen waited on his wife. as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could the farmergeneralhowsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day.  for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable businessif that could have been anybodys business at the house of monseigneur. military officers destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the score. people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were no less abundant. doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly patients in the antechambers of monseigneur. projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur. unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making cardtowers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur. exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur. such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and appearance owned to being a mother. indeed except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion. peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.  the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur. in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. as a promising way of setting them right half of the halfdozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible fingerpost to the future for monseigneurs guidance. besides these dervishes were other three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truthwhich did not need much demonstrationbut had not got out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre by fasting and seeing of spirits. among these accordingly much discoursing with spirits went onand it did a world of good which never became manifest.  but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed. if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally correct. such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and ever. the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away.  dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places. everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off. from the palace of the tuileries through monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was required to officiate frizzled powdered in a goldlaced coat pumps and white silk stockings. at the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a raritymonsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call him presided in this dainty dress. and who among the company at monseigneurs reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman powdered goldlaced pumped and whitesilk stockinged would see the very stars out  monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open and issued forth. then what submission what cringing and fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heavenwhich may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it.  bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth. there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites and was seen no more.  the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. there was soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm and his snuffbox in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.  i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil  with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs.  he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and with a face like a fine mask. a face of a transparent paleness every feature in it clearly defined one set expression on it. the nose beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. in those two compressions or dints the only little change that the face ever showed resided. they persisted in changing colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation then they gave a look of treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance. examined with attention its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of the eyes being much too horizontal and thin still in the effect of the face made it was a handsome face and a remarkable one.  its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and drove away. not many people had talked with him at the reception he had stood in a little space apart and monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. it appeared under the circumstances rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses and often barely escaping from being run down. his man drove as if he were charging an enemy and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face or to the lips of the master. the complaint had sometimes made itself audible even in that deaf city and dumb age that in the narrow streets without footways the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. but few cared enough for that to think of it a second time and in this matter as in all others the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.  with a wild rattle and clatter and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners with women screaming before it and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was a loud cry from a number of voices and the horses reared and plunged.  but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would not have stopped carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded behind and why not but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles.  what has gone wrong said monsieur calmly looking out.  a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountain and was down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal.  pardon monsieur the marquis said a ragged and submissive man it is a child.  why does he make that abominable noise is it his child  excuse me monsieur the marquisit is a pityyes.  the fountain was a little removed for the street opened where it was into a space some ten or twelve yards square. as the tall man suddenly got up from the ground and came running at the carriage monsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his swordhilt.  killed shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both arms at their length above his head and staring at him. dead  the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis. there was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness there was no visible menacing or anger. neither did the people say anything after the first cry they had been silent and they remained so. the voice of the submissive man who had spoken was flat and tame in its extreme submission. monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.  he took out his purse.  it is extraordinary to me said he that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. one or the other of you is for ever in the way. how do i know what injury you have done my horses. see give him that.  he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. the tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry dead  he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom the rest made way. on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it. they were as silent however as the men.  i know all i know all said the last comer. be a brave man my gaspard it is better for the poor little plaything to die so than to live. it has died in a moment without pain. could it have lived an hour as happily  you are a philosopher you there said the marquis smiling. how do they call you  they call me defarge.  of what trade  monsieur the marquis vendor of wine.  pick up that philosopher and vendor of wine said the marquis throwing him another gold coin and spend it as you will. the horses there are they right  without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time monsieur the marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing and had paid for it and could afford to pay for it when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor.  hold said monsieur the marquis. hold the horses who threw that  he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood a moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman knitting.  you dogs said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchanged front except as to the spots on his nose i would ride over any of you very willingly and exterminate you from the earth. if i knew which rascal threw at the carriage and if that brigand were sufficiently near it he should be crushed under the wheels.  so cowed was their condition and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them within the law and beyond it that not a voice or a hand or even an eye was raised. among the men not one. but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the marquis in the face. it was not for his dignity to notice it his contemptuous eyes passed over her and over all the other rats and he leaned back in his seat again and gave the word go on  he was driven on and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession the minister the stateprojector the farmergeneral the doctor the lawyer the ecclesiastic the grand opera the comedy the whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow came whirling by. the rats had crept out of their holes to look on and they remained looking on for hours soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk and through which they peeped. the father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the fancy ballwhen the one woman who had stood conspicuous knitting still knitted on with the steadfastness of fate. the water of the fountain ran the swift river ran the day ran into evening so much life in the city ran into death according to rule time and tide waited for no man the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again the fancy ball was lighted up at supper all things ran their course.     chapter viii. monseigneur in the country   a beautiful landscape with the corn bright in it but not abundant. patches of poor rye where corn should have been patches of poor peas and beans patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. on inanimate nature as on the men and women who cultivated it a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillinglya dejected disposition to give up and wither away.  monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter conducted by four posthorses and two postilions fagged up a steep hill. a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun.  the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped in crimson. it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly.  in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.  but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home.  the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments. it had its poor people too. all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed.  few children were to be seen and no dogs. as to the men and women their choice on earth was stated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag.  heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their heads in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate. it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.  monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the courtonly the difference was that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiatewhen a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.  bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier.  the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain.  i passed you on the road  monseigneur it is true. i had the honour of being passed on the road.  coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both  monseigneur it is true.  what did you look at so fixedly  monseigneur i looked at the man.  he stooped a little and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage. all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.  what man pig and why look there  pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoethe drag.  who demanded the traveller.  monseigneur the man.  may the devil carry away these idiots how do you call the man you know all the men of this part of the country. who was he  your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the country. of all the days of my life i never saw him.  swinging by the chain to be suffocated  with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur. his head hanging overlike this  he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down then recovered himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow.  what was he like  monseigneur he was whiter than the miller. all covered with dust white as a spectre tall as a spectre  the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd but all eyes without comparing notes with other eyes looked at monsieur the marquis. perhaps to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.  truly you did well said the marquis felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him to see a thief accompanying my carriage and not open that great mouth of yours. bah put him aside monsieur gabelle  monsieur gabelle was the postmaster and some other taxing functionary united he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner.  bah go aside said monsieur gabelle.  lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village tonight and be sure that his business is honest gabelle.  monseigneur i am flattered to devote myself to your orders.  did he run away fellowwhere is that accursed  the accursed was already under the carriage with some halfdozen particular friends pointing out the chain with his blue cap. some halfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out and presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis.  did the man run away dolt when we stopped for the drag  monseigneur he precipitated himself over the hillside head first as a person plunges into the river.  see to it gabelle. go on  the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate.  the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night. the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dull distance.  at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burialground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifehis own life maybefor it was dreadfully spare and thin.  to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling. she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriagedoor.  it is you monseigneur monseigneur a petition.  with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out.  how then what is it always petitions  monseigneur. for the love of the great god my husband the forester.  what of your husband the forester always the same with you people. he cannot pay something  he has paid all monseigneur. he is dead.  well he is quiet. can i restore him to you  alas no monseigneur but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass.  well  monseigneur there are so many little heaps of poor grass  again well  she looked an old woman but was young. her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoortenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want.  again well can i feed them  monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it. my petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husbands name may be placed over him to show where he lies. otherwise the place will be quickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady i shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much want. monseigneur monseigneur  the valet had put her away from the door the carriage had broken into a brisk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left far behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau.  the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him and rose as the rain falls impartially on the dusty ragged and toilworn group at the fountain not far away to whom the mender of roads with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing still enlarged upon his man like a spectre as long as they could bear it. by degrees as they could bear no more they dropped off one by one and lights twinkled in little casements which lights as the casements darkened and more stars came out seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.  the shadow of a large highroofed house and of many overhanging trees was upon monsieur the marquis by that time and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau as his carriage stopped and the great door of his chateau was opened to him.  monsieur charles whom i expect is he arrived from england  monseigneur not yet.     chapter ix. the gorgons head   it was a heavy mass of building that chateau of monsieur the marquis with a large stone courtyard before it and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. a stony business altogether with heavy stone balustrades and stone urns and stone flowers and stone faces of men and stone heads of lions in all directions. as if the gorgons head had surveyed it when it was finished two centuries ago.  up the broad flight of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeau preceded went from his carriage sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees. all else was so quiet that the flambeau carried up the steps and the other flambeau held at the great door burnt as if they were in a close room of state instead of being in the open nightair. other sound than the owls voice there was none save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin for it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together and then heave a long low sigh and hold their breath again.  the great door clanged behind him and monsieur the marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boarspears swords and knives of the chase grimmer with certain heavy ridingrods and ridingwhips of which many a peasant gone to his benefactor death had felt the weight when his lord was angry.  avoiding the larger rooms which were dark and made fast for the night monsieur the marquis with his flambeaubearer going on before went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. this thrown open admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms his bedchamber and two others. high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. the fashion of the last louis but one of the line that was never to breakthe fourteenth louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture but it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of france.  a suppertable was laid for two in the third of the rooms a round room in one of the chateaus four extinguishertopped towers. a small lofty room with its window wide open and the wooden jalousieblinds closed so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.  my nephew said the marquis glancing at the supper preparation they said he was not arrived.  nor was he but he had been expected with monseigneur.  ah it is not probable he will arrive tonight nevertheless leave the table as it is. i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.  in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. his chair was opposite to the window and he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his lips when he put it down.  what is that he calmly asked looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.  monseigneur that  outside the blinds. open the blinds.  it was done.  well  monseigneur it is nothing. the trees and the night are all that are here.  the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked out into the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind him looking round for instructions.  good said the imperturbable master. close them again.  that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper. he was half way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand hearing the sound of wheels. it came on briskly and came up to the front of the chateau.  ask who is arrived.  it was the nephew of monseigneur. he had been some few leagues behind monseigneur early in the afternoon. he had diminished the distance rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road. he had heard of monseigneur at the postinghouses as being before him.  he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and there and that he was prayed to come to it. in a little while he came. he had been known in england as charles darnay.  monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shake hands.  you left paris yesterday sir he said to monseigneur as he took his seat at table.  yesterday. and you  i come direct.  from london  yes.  you have been a long time coming said the marquis with a smile.  on the contrary i come direct.  pardon me i mean not a long time on the journey a long time intending the journey.  i have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his answervarious business.  without doubt said the polished uncle.  so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them. when coffee had been served and they were alone together the nephew looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask opened a conversation.  i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that took me away. it carried me into great and unexpected peril but it is a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have sustained me.  not to death said the uncle it is not necessary to say to death.  i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there.  the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.  indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.  no no no said the uncle pleasantly.  but however that may be resumed the nephew glancing at him with deep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means and would know no scruple as to means.  my friend i told you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation in the two marks. do me the favour to recall that i told you so long ago.  i recall it.  thank you said the marquisvery sweetly indeed.  his tone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musical instrument.  in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to be at once your bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in france here.  i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffee. dare i ask you to explain  i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.  it is possible said the uncle with great calmness. for the honour of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. pray excuse me  i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before yesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew.  i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle with refined politeness i would not be sure of that. a good opportunity for consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. but it is useless to discuss the question. i am as you say at a disadvantage. these little instruments of correction these gentle aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that might so incommode you are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. they are sought by so many and they are granted comparatively to so few it used not to be so but france in all such things is changed for the worse. our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. from this room many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged in the next room my bedroom one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter we have lost many privileges a new philosophy has become the mode and the assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as to say would but might cause us real inconvenience. all very bad very bad  the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his head as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself that great means of regeneration.  we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our name to be more detested than any name in france.  let us hope so said the uncle. detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.  there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face i can look at in all this country round about us which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.  a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the family merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur. hah and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff and lightly crossed his legs.  but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness closeness and dislike than was comportable with its wearers assumption of indifference.  repression is the only lasting philosophy. the dark deference of fear and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep the dogs obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to it shuts out the sky.  that might not be so long as the marquis supposed. if a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence could have been shown to him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly firecharred plunderwrecked rains. as for the roof he vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit for ever from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.  meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour and repose of the family if you will not. but you must be fatigued. shall we terminate our conference for the night  a moment more.  an hour if you please.  sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits of wrong.  we have done wrong repeated the marquis with an inquiring smile and delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself.  our family our honourable family whose honour is of so much account to both of us in such different ways. even in my fathers time we did a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure whatever it was. why need i speak of my fathers time when it is equally yours can i separate my fathers twinbrother joint inheritor and next successor from himself  death has done that said the marquis.  and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that is frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it seeking to execute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the last look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.  seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him on the breast with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou will for ever seek them in vain be assured.  every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was cruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood looking quietly at his nephew with his snuffbox in his hand. once again he touched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword with which in delicate finesse he ran him through the body and said  my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have lived.  when he had said it he took a culminating pinch of snuff and put his box in his pocket.  better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing a small bell on the table and accept your natural destiny. but you are lost monsieur charles i see.  this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadly i renounce them.  are they both yours to renounce france may be but is the property it is scarcely worth mentioning but is it yet  i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet. if it passed to me from you tomorrow  which i have the vanity to hope is not probable.  or twenty years hence  you do me too much honour said the marquis still i prefer that supposition.  i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere. it is little to relinquish. what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin  hah said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room.  to the eye it is fair enough here but seen in its integrity under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hunger nakedness and suffering.  hah said the marquis again in a wellsatisfied manner.  if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in another generation suffer less but it is not for me. there is a curse on it and on all this land.  and you said the uncle. forgive my curiosity do you under your new philosophy graciously intend to live  i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at their backs may have to do some daywork.  in england for example  yes. the family honour sir is safe from me in this country. the family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other.  the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to be lighted. it now shone brightly through the door of communication. the marquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of his valet.  england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently you have prospered there he observed then turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.  i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may be indebted to you sir. for the rest it is my refuge.  they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of many. you know a compatriot who has found a refuge there a doctor  yes.  with a daughter  yes.  yes said the marquis. you are fatigued. good night  as he bent his head in his most courtly manner there was a secrecy in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. at the same time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes and the thin straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.  yes repeated the marquis. a doctor with a daughter. yes. so commences the new philosophy you are fatigued. good night  it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. the nephew looked at him in vain in passing on to the door.  good night said the uncle. i look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. good repose light monsieur my nephew to his chamber thereand burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will he added to himself before he rang his little bell again and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.  the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamberrobe to prepare himself gently for sleep that hot still night. rustling about the room his softlyslippered feet making no noise on the floor he moved like a refined tigerlooked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort in story whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off or just coming on.  he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again at the scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind the slow toil up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent the mill the prison on the crag the little village in the hollow the peasants at the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage. that fountain suggested the paris fountain the little bundle lying on the step the women bending over it and the tall man with his arms up crying dead  i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may go to bed.  so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.  the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours for three heavy hours the horses in the stables rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by menpoets. but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.  for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion and human stared blindly at the night. dead darkness lay on all the landscape dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. the burialplace had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another the figure on the cross might have come down for anything that could be seen of it. in the village taxers and taxed were fast asleep. dreaming perhaps of banquets as the starved usually do and of ease and rest as the driven slave and the yoked ox may its lean inhabitants slept soundly and were fed and freed.  the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheardboth melting away like the minutes that were falling from the spring of timethrough three dark hours. then the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.  lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees and poured its radiance over the hill. in the glow the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stone faces crimsoned. the carol of the birds was loud and high and on the weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieur the marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed and with open mouth and dropped underjaw looked awestricken.  now the sun was full up and movement began in the village. casement windows opened crazy doors were unbarred and people came forth shiveringchilled as yet by the new sweet air. then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. some to the fountain some to the fields men and women here to dig and delve men and women there to see to the poor live stock and lead the bony cows out to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. in the church and at the cross a kneeling figure or two attendant on the latter prayers the led cow trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.  the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awoke gradually and surely. first the lonely boarspears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old then had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine now doors and windows were thrown open horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways leaves sparkled and rustled at irongrated windows dogs pulled hard at their chains and reared impatient to be loosed.  all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life and the return of morning. surely not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau nor the running up and down the stairs nor the hurried figures on the terrace nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away  what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads already at work on the hilltop beyond the village with his days dinner not much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crows while to peck at on a heap of stones had the birds carrying some grains of it to a distance dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds whether or no the mender of roads ran on the sultry morning as if for his life down the hill kneehigh in dust and never stopped till he got to the fountain.  all the people of the village were at the fountain standing about in their depressed manner and whispering low but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. the led cows hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them were looking stupidly on or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. some of the people of the chateau and some of those of the postinghouse and all the taxing authorities were armed more or less and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way that was highly fraught with nothing. already the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. what did all this portend and what portended the swift hoistingup of monsieur gabelle behind a servant on horseback and the conveying away of the said gabelle doubleladen though the horse was at a gallop like a new version of the german ballad of leonora  it portended that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau.  the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night and had added the one stone face wanting the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.  it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis. it was like a fine mask suddenly startled made angry and petrified. driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it was a knife. round its hilt was a frill of paper on which was scrawled  drive him fast to his tomb. this from jacques.     chapter x. two promises   more months to the number of twelve had come and gone and mr. charles darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french language who was conversant with french literature. in this age he would have been a professor in that age he was a tutor. he read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. he could write of them besides in sound english and render them into sound english. such masters were not at that time easily found princes that had been and kings that were to be were not yet of the teacher class and no ruined nobility had dropped out of tellsons ledgers to turn cooks and carpenters. as a tutor whose attainments made the students way unusually pleasant and profitable and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge young mr. darnay soon became known and encouraged. he was well acquainted moreover with the circumstances of his country and those were of evergrowing interest. so with great perseverance and untiring industry he prospered.  in london he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold nor to lie on beds of roses if he had had any such exalted expectation he would not have prospered. he had expected labour and he found it and did it and made the best of it. in this his prosperity consisted.  a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in european languages instead of conveying greek and latin through the customhouse. the rest of his time he passed in london.  now from the days when it was always summer in eden to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes the world of a man has invariably gone one waycharles darnays waythe way of the love of a woman.  he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger. he had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. but he had not yet spoken to her on the subject the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long long dusty roadsthe solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dreamhad been done a year and he had never yet by so much as a single spoken word disclosed to her the state of his heart.  that he had his reasons for this he knew full well. it was again a summer day when lately arrived in london from his college occupation he turned into the quiet corner in soho bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to doctor manette. it was the close of the summer day and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross.  he found the doctor reading in his armchair at a window. the energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness had been gradually restored to him. he was now a very energetic man indeed with great firmness of purpose strength of resolution and vigour of action. in his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties but this had never been frequently observable and had grown more and more rare.  he studied much slept little sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease and was equably cheerful. to him now entered charles darnay at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.  charles darnay i rejoice to see you. we have been counting on your return these three or four days past. mr. stryver and sydney carton were both here yesterday and both made you out to be more than due.  i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter he answered a little coldly as to them though very warmly as to the doctor. miss manette  is well said the doctor as he stopped short and your return will delight us all. she has gone out on some household matters but will soon be home.  doctor manette i knew she was from home. i took the opportunity of her being from home to beg to speak to you.  there was a blank silence.  yes said the doctor with evident constraint. bring your chair here and speak on.  he complied as to the chair but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.  i have had the happiness doctor manette of being so intimate here  so he at length began for some year and a half that i hope the topic on which i am about to touch may not  he was stayed by the doctors putting out his hand to stop him. when he had kept it so a little while he said drawing it back  is lucie the topic  she is.  it is hard for me to speak of her at any time. it is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours charles darnay.  it is a tone of fervent admiration true homage and deep love doctor manette he said deferentially.  there was another blank silence before her father rejoined  i believe it. i do you justice i believe it.  his constraint was so manifest and it was so manifest too that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject that charles darnay hesitated.  shall i go on sir  another blank.  yes go on.  you anticipate what i would say though you cannot know how earnestly i say it how earnestly i feel it without knowing my secret heart and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. dear doctor manette i love your daughter fondly dearly disinterestedly devotedly. if ever there were love in the world i love her. you have loved yourself let your old love speak for me  the doctor sat with his face turned away and his eyes bent on the ground. at the last words he stretched out his hand again hurriedly and cried  not that sir let that be i adjure you do not recall that  his cry was so like a cry of actual pain that it rang in charles darnays ears long after he had ceased. he motioned with the hand he had extended and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause. the latter so received it and remained silent.  i ask your pardon said the doctor in a subdued tone after some moments. i do not doubt your loving lucie you may be satisfied of it.  he turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him or raise his eyes. his chin dropped upon his hand and his white hair overshadowed his face  have you spoken to lucie  no.  nor written  never.  it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your selfdenial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. her father thanks you.  he offered his hand but his eyes did not go with it.  i know said darnay respectfully how can i fail to know doctor manette i who have seen you together from day to day that between you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual so touching so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured that it can have few parallels even in the tenderness between a father and child. i know doctor manettehow can i fail to knowthat mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman there is in her heart towards you all the love and reliance of infancy itself. i know that as in her childhood she had no parent so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. i know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life you could hardly be invested in her sight with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. i know that when she is clinging to you the hands of baby girl and woman all in one are round your neck. i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age sees and loves you at my age loves her mother brokenhearted loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. i have known this night and day since i have known you in your home.  her father sat silent with his face bent down. his breathing was a little quickened but he repressed all other signs of agitation.  dear doctor manette always knowing this always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you i have forborne and forborne as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. i have felt and do even now feel that to bring my loveeven minebetween you is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. but i love her. heaven is my witness that i love her  i believe it answered her father mournfully. i have thought so before now. i believe it.  but do not believe said darnay upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound that if my fortune were so cast as that being one day so happy as to make her my wife i must at any time put any separation between her and you i could or would breathe a word of what i now say. besides that i should know it to be hopeless i should know it to be a baseness. if i had any such possibility even at a remote distance of years harboured in my thoughts and hidden in my heartif it ever had been thereif it ever could be therei could not now touch this honoured hand.  he laid his own upon it as he spoke.  no dear doctor manette. like you a voluntary exile from france like you driven from it by its distractions oppressions and miseries like you striving to live away from it by my own exertions and trusting in a happier future i look only to sharing your fortunes sharing your life and home and being faithful to you to the death. not to divide with lucie her privilege as your child companion and friend but to come in aid of it and bind her closer to you if such a thing can be.  his touch still lingered on her fathers hand. answering the touch for a moment but not coldly her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference. a struggle was evidently in his face a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.  you speak so feelingly and so manfully charles darnay that i thank you with all my heart and will open all my heartor nearly so. have you any reason to believe that lucie loves you  none. as yet none.  is it the immediate object of this confidence that you may at once ascertain that with my knowledge  not even so. i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks i might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow.  do you seek any guidance from me  i ask none sir. but i have thought it possible that you might have it in your power if you should deem it right to give me some.  do you seek any promise from me  i do seek that.  what is it  i well understand that without you i could have no hope. i well understand that even if miss manette held me at this moment in her innocent heartdo not think i have the presumption to assume so muchi could retain no place in it against her love for her father.  if that be so do you see what on the other hand is involved in it  i understand equally well that a word from her father in any suitors favour would outweigh herself and all the world. for which reason doctor manette said darnay modestly but firmly i would not ask that word to save my life.  i am sure of it. charles darnay mysteries arise out of close love as well as out of wide division in the former case they are subtle and delicate and difficult to penetrate. my daughter lucie is in this one respect such a mystery to me i can make no guess at the state of her heart.  may i ask sir if you think she is as he hesitated her father supplied the rest.  is sought by any other suitor  it is what i meant to say.  her father considered a little before he answered  you have seen mr. carton here yourself. mr. stryver is here too occasionally. if it be at all it can only be by one of these.  or both said darnay.  i had not thought of both i should not think either likely. you want a promise from me. tell me what it is.  it is that if miss manette should bring to you at any time on her own part such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you you will bear testimony to what i have said and to your belief in it. i hope you may be able to think so well of me as to urge no influence against me. i say nothing more of my stake in this this is what i ask. the condition on which i ask it and which you have an undoubted right to require i will observe immediately.  i give the promise said the doctor without any condition. i believe your object to be purely and truthfully as you have stated it. i believe your intention is to perpetuate and not to weaken the ties between me and my other and far dearer self. if she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness i will give her to you. if there werecharles darnay if there were  the young man had taken his hand gratefully their hands were joined as the doctor spoke  any fancies any reasons any apprehensions anything whatsoever new or old against the man she really lovedthe direct responsibility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for her sake. she is everything to me more to me than suffering more to me than wrong more to mewell this is idle talk.  so strange was the way in which he faded into silence and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak that darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.  you said something to me said doctor manette breaking into a smile. what was it you said to me  he was at a loss how to answer until he remembered having spoken of a condition. relieved as his mind reverted to that he answered  your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. my present name though but slightly changed from my mothers is not as you will remember my own. i wish to tell you what that is and why i am in england.  stop said the doctor of beauvais.  i wish it that i may the better deserve your confidence and have no secret from you.  stop  for an instant the doctor even had his two hands at his ears for another instant even had his two hands laid on darnays lips.  tell me when i ask you not now. if your suit should prosper if lucie should love you you shall tell me on your marriage morning. do you promise  willingly.  give me your hand. she will be home directly and it is better she should not see us together tonight. go god bless you  it was dark when charles darnay left him and it was an hour later and darker when lucie came home she hurried into the room alonefor miss pross had gone straight upstairsand was surprised to find his readingchair empty.  my father she called to him. father dear  nothing was said in answer but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. passing lightly across the intermediate room she looked in at his door and came running back frightened crying to herself with her blood all chilled what shall i do what shall i do  her uncertainty lasted but a moment she hurried back and tapped at his door and softly called to him. the noise ceased at the sound of her voice and he presently came out to her and they walked up and down together for a long time.  she came down from her bed to look at him in his sleep that night. he slept heavily and his tray of shoemaking tools and his old unfinished work were all as usual.     chapter xi. a companion picture   sydney said mr. stryver on that selfsame night or morning to his jackal mix another bowl of punch i have something to say to you.  sydney had been working double tides that night and the night before and the night before that and a good many nights in succession making a grand clearance among mr. stryvers papers before the setting in of the long vacation. the clearance was effected at last the stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up everything was got rid of until november should come with its fogs atmospheric and fogs legal and bring grist to the mill again.  sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. it had taken a deal of extra wettowelling to pull him through the night a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling and he was in a very damaged condition as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.  are you mixing that other bowl of punch said stryver the portly with his hands in his waistband glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.  i am.  now look here i am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. i intend to marry.  do you  yes. and not for money. what do you say now  i dont feel disposed to say much. who is she  guess.  do i know her  guess.  i am not going to guess at five oclock in the morning with my brains frying and sputtering in my head. if you want me to guess you must ask me to dinner.  well then ill tell you said stryver coming slowly into a sitting posture. sydney i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you because you are such an insensible dog.  and you returned sydney busy concocting the punch are such a sensitive and poetical spirit  come rejoined stryver laughing boastfully though i dont prefer any claim to being the soul of romance for i hope i know better still i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you.  you are a luckier if you mean that.  i dont mean that. i mean i am a man of moremore  say gallantry while you are about it suggested carton.  well ill say gallantry. my meaning is that i am a man said stryver inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch who cares more to be agreeable who takes more pains to be agreeable who knows better how to be agreeable in a womans society than you do.  go on said sydney carton.  no but before i go on said stryver shaking his head in his bullying way ill have this out with you. youve been at doctor manettes house as much as i have or more than i have. why i have been ashamed of your moroseness there your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind that upon my life and soul i have been ashamed of you sydney  it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar to be ashamed of anything returned sydney you ought to be much obliged to me.  you shall not get off in that way rejoined stryver shouldering the rejoinder at him no sydney its my duty to tell youand i tell you to your face to do you goodthat you are a devilish illconditioned fellow in that sort of society. you are a disagreeable fellow.  sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made and laughed.  look at me said stryver squaring himself i have less need to make myself agreeable than you have being more independent in circumstances. why do i do it  i never saw you do it yet muttered carton.  i do it because its politic i do it on principle. and look at me i get on.  you dont get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions  answered carton with a careless air i wish you would keep to that. as to mewill you never understand that i am incorrigible  he asked the question with some appearance of scorn.  you have no business to be incorrigible was his friends answer delivered in no very soothing tone.  i have no business to be at all that i know of said sydney carton. who is the lady  now dont let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable sydney said mr. stryver preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make because i know you dont mean half you say and if you meant it all it would be of no importance. i make this little preface because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.  i did  certainly and in these chambers.  sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.  you made mention of the young lady as a goldenhaired doll. the young lady is miss manette. if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way sydney i might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation but you are not. you want that sense altogether therefore i am no more annoyed when i think of the expression than i should be annoyed by a mans opinion of a picture of mine who had no eye for pictures or of a piece of music of mine who had no ear for music.  sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate drank it by bumpers looking at his friend.  now you know all about it syd said mr. stryver. i dont care about fortune she is a charming creature and i have made up my mind to please myself on the whole i think i can afford to please myself. she will have in me a man already pretty well off and a rapidly rising man and a man of some distinction it is a piece of good fortune for her but she is worthy of good fortune. are you astonished  carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i be astonished  you approve  carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i not approve  well said his friend stryver you take it more easily than i fancied you would and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would be though to be sure you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. yes sydney i have had enough of this style of life with no other as a change from it i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it when he doesnt he can stay away and i feel that miss manette will tell well in any station and will always do me credit. so i have made up my mind. and now sydney old boy i want to say a word to you about your prospects. you are in a bad way you know you really are in a bad way. you dont know the value of money you live hard youll knock up one of these days and be ill and poor you really ought to think about a nurse.  the prosperous patronage with which he said it made him look twice as big as he was and four times as offensive.  now let me recommend you pursued stryver to look it in the face. i have looked it in the face in my different way look it in the face you in your different way. marry. provide somebody to take care of you. never mind your having no enjoyment of womens society nor understanding of it nor tact for it. find out somebody. find out some respectable woman with a little propertysomebody in the landlady way or lodgingletting wayand marry her against a rainy day. thats the kind of thing for you. now think of it sydney.  ill think of it said sydney.     chapter xii. the fellow of delicacy   mr. stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the doctors daughter resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the long vacation. after some mental debating of the point he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before michaelmas term or in the little christmas vacation between it and hilary.  as to the strength of his case he had not a doubt about it but clearly saw his way to the verdict. argued with the jury on substantial worldly groundsthe only grounds ever worth taking into accountit was a plain case and had not a weak spot in it. he called himself for the plaintiff there was no getting over his evidence the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief and the jury did not even turn to consider. after trying it stryver c. j. was satisfied that no plainer case could be.  accordingly mr. stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens that failing to ranelagh that unaccountably failing too it behoved him to present himself in soho and there declare his noble mind.  towards soho therefore mr. stryver shouldered his way from the temple while the bloom of the long vacations infancy was still upon it. anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet on saint dunstans side of temple bar bursting in his fullblown way along the pavement to the jostlement of all weaker people might have seen how safe and strong he was.  his way taking him past tellsons and he both banking at tellsons and knowing mr. lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes it entered mr. stryvers mind to enter the bank and reveal to mr. lorry the brightness of the soho horizon. so he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat stumbled down the two steps got past the two ancient cashiers and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr. lorry sat at great books ruled for figures with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too and everything under the clouds were a sum.  halloa said mr. stryver. how do you do i hope you are well  it was stryvers grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place or space. he was so much too big for tellsons that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance as though he squeezed them against the wall. the house itself magnificently reading the paper quite in the faroff perspective lowered displeased as if the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.  the discreet mr. lorry said in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances how do you do mr. stryver how do you do sir and shook hands. there was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands always to be seen in any clerk at tellsons who shook hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air. he shook in a selfabnegating way as one who shook for tellson and co.  can i do anything for you mr. stryver asked mr. lorry in his business character.  why no thank you this is a private visit to yourself mr. lorry i have come for a private word.  oh indeed said mr. lorry bending down his ear while his eye strayed to the house afar off.  i am going said mr. stryver leaning his arms confidentially on the desk whereupon although it was a large double one there appeared to be not half desk enough for him i am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend miss manette mr. lorry.  oh dear me cried mr. lorry rubbing his chin and looking at his visitor dubiously.  oh dear me sir repeated stryver drawing back. oh dear you sir what may your meaning be mr. lorry  my meaning answered the man of business is of course friendly and appreciative and that it does you the greatest credit andin short my meaning is everything you could desire. butreally you know mr. stryver mr. lorry paused and shook his head at him in the oddest manner as if he were compelled against his will to add internally you know there really is so much too much of you  well said stryver slapping the desk with his contentious hand opening his eyes wider and taking a long breath if i understand you mr. lorry ill be hanged  mr. lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end and bit the feather of a pen.  dn it all sir said stryver staring at him am i not eligible  oh dear yes yes. oh yes youre eligible said mr. lorry. if you say eligible you are eligible.  am i not prosperous asked stryver.  oh if you come to prosperous you are prosperous said mr. lorry.  and advancing  if you come to advancing you know said mr. lorry delighted to be able to make another admission nobody can doubt that.  then what on earth is your meaning mr. lorry demanded stryver perceptibly crestfallen.  well iwere you going there now asked mr. lorry.  straight said stryver with a plump of his fist on the desk.  then i think i wouldnt if i was you.  why said stryver. now ill put you in a corner forensically shaking a forefinger at him. you are a man of business and bound to have a reason. state your reason. why wouldnt you go  because said mr. lorry i wouldnt go on such an object without having some cause to believe that i should succeed.  dn me cried stryver but this beats everything.  mr. lorry glanced at the distant house and glanced at the angry stryver.  heres a man of businessa man of yearsa man of experiencein a bank said stryver and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success he says theres no reason at all says it with his head on mr. stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.  when i speak of success i speak of success with the young lady and when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable i speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. the young lady my good sir said mr. lorry mildly tapping the stryver arm the young lady. the young lady goes before all.  then you mean to tell me mr. lorry said stryver squaring his elbows that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing fool  not exactly so. i mean to tell you mr. stryver said mr. lorry reddening that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips and that if i knew any manwhich i hope i do notwhose taste was so coarse and whose temper was so overbearing that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk not even tellsons should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.  the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr. stryvers bloodvessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry mr. lorrys veins methodical as their courses could usually be were in no better state now it was his turn.  that is what i mean to tell you sir said mr. lorry. pray let there be no mistake about it.  mr. stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it which probably gave him the toothache. he broke the awkward silence by saying  this is something new to me mr. lorry. you deliberately advise me not to go up to soho and offer myselfmyself stryver of the kings bench bar  do you ask me for my advice mr. stryver  yes i do.  very good. then i give it and you have repeated it correctly.  and all i can say of it is laughed stryver with a vexed laugh that thisha habeats everything past present and to come.  now understand me pursued mr. lorry. as a man of business i am not justified in saying anything about this matter for as a man of business i know nothing of it. but as an old fellow who has carried miss manette in his arms who is the trusted friend of miss manette and of her father too and who has a great affection for them both i have spoken. the confidence is not of my seeking recollect. now you think i may not be right  not i said stryver whistling. i cant undertake to find third parties in common sense i can only find it for myself. i suppose sense in certain quarters you suppose mincing breadandbutter nonsense. its new to me but you are right i dare say.  what i suppose mr. stryver i claim to characterise for myselfand understand me sir said mr. lorry quickly flushing again i will notnot even at tellsonshave it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.  there i beg your pardon said stryver.  granted. thank you. well mr. stryver i was about to sayit might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken it might be painful to doctor manette to have the task of being explicit with you it might be very painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you. you know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. if you please committing you in no way representing you in no way i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. if you should then be dissatisfied with it you can but test its soundness for yourself if on the other hand you should be satisfied with it and it should be what it now is it may spare all sides what is best spared. what do you say  how long would you keep me in town  oh it is only a question of a few hours. i could go to soho in the evening and come to your chambers afterwards.  then i say yes said stryver i wont go up there now i am not so hot upon it as that comes to i say yes and i shall expect you to look in tonight. good morning.  then mr. stryver turned and burst out of the bank causing such a concussion of air on his passage through that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks. those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing and were popularly believed when they had bowed a customer out still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.  the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty. unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow he got it down. and now said mr. stryver shaking his forensic forefinger at the temple in general when it was down my way out of this is to put you all in the wrong.  it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician in which he found great relief. you shall not put me in the wrong young lady said mr. stryver ill do that for you.  accordingly when mr. lorry called that night as late as ten oclock mr. stryver among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning. he even showed surprise when he saw mr. lorry and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.  well said that goodnatured emissary after a full halfhour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. i have been to soho.  to soho repeated mr. stryver coldly. oh to be sure what am i thinking of  and i have no doubt said mr. lorry that i was right in the conversation we had. my opinion is confirmed and i reiterate my advice.  i assure you returned mr. stryver in the friendliest way that i am sorry for it on your account and sorry for it on the poor fathers account. i know this must always be a sore subject with the family let us say no more about it.  i dont understand you said mr. lorry.  i dare say not rejoined stryver nodding his head in a smoothing and final way no matter no matter.  but it does matter mr. lorry urged.  no it doesnt i assure you it doesnt. having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition i am well out of my mistake and no harm is done. young women have committed similar follies often before and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. in an unselfish aspect i am sorry that the thing is dropped because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view in a selfish aspect i am glad that the thing has dropped because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of viewit is hardly necessary to say i could have gained nothing by it. there is no harm at all done. i have not proposed to the young lady and between ourselves i am by no means certain on reflection that i ever should have committed myself to that extent. mr. lorry you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of emptyheaded girls you must not expect to do it or you will always be disappointed. now pray say no more about it. i tell you i regret it on account of others but i am satisfied on my own account. and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you and for giving me your advice you know the young lady better than i do you were right it never would have done.  mr. lorry was so taken aback that he looked quite stupidly at mr. stryver shouldering him towards the door with an appearance of showering generosity forbearance and goodwill on his erring head. make the best of it my dear sir said stryver say no more about it thank you again for allowing me to sound you good night  mr. lorry was out in the night before he knew where he was. mr. stryver was lying back on his sofa winking at his ceiling.     chapter xiii. the fellow of no delicacy   if sydney carton ever shone anywhere he certainly never shone in the house of doctor manette. he had been there often during a whole year and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. when he cared to talk he talked well but the cloud of caring for nothing which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness was very rarely pierced by the light within him.  and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things else forgotten and unattainable into his mind. of late the neglected bed in the temple court had known him more scantily than ever and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes he had got up again and haunted that neighbourhood.  on a day in august when mr. stryver after notifying to his jackal that he had thought better of that marrying matter had carried his delicacy into devonshire and when the sight and scent of flowers in the city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst of health for the sickliest and of youth for the oldest sydneys feet still trod those stones. from being irresolute and purposeless his feet became animated by an intention and in the working out of that intention they took him to the doctors door.  he was shown upstairs and found lucie at her work alone. she had never been quite at her ease with him and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. but looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few commonplaces she observed a change in it.  i fear you are not well mr. carton  no. but the life i lead miss manette is not conducive to health. what is to be expected of or by such profligates  is it notforgive me i have begun the question on my lipsa pity to live no better life  god knows it is a shame  then why not change it  looking gently at him again she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes. there were tears in his voice too as he answered  it is too late for that. i shall never be better than i am. i shall sink lower and be worse.  he leaned an elbow on her table and covered his eyes with his hand. the table trembled in the silence that followed.  she had never seen him softened and was much distressed. he knew her to be so without looking at her and said  pray forgive me miss manette. i break down before the knowledge of what i want to say to you. will you hear me  if it will do you any good mr. carton if it would make you happier it would make me very glad  god bless you for your sweet compassion  he unshaded his face after a little while and spoke steadily.  dont be afraid to hear me. dont shrink from anything i say. i am like one who died young. all my life might have been.  no mr. carton. i am sure that the best part of it might still be i am sure that you might be much much worthier of yourself.  say of you miss manette and although i know betteralthough in the mystery of my own wretched heart i know betteri shall never forget it  she was pale and trembling. he came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.  if it had been possible miss manette that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourselfflung away wasted drunken poor creature of misuse as you know him to behe would have been conscious this day and hour in spite of his happiness that he would bring you to misery bring you to sorrow and repentance blight you disgrace you pull you down with him. i know very well that you can have no tenderness for me i ask for none i am even thankful that it cannot be.  without it can i not save you mr. carton can i not recall youforgive me againto a better course can i in no way repay your confidence i know this is a confidence she modestly said after a little hesitation and in earnest tears i know you would say this to no one else. can i turn it to no good account for yourself mr. carton  he shook his head.  to none. no miss manette to none. if you will hear me through a very little more all you can ever do for me is done. i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. in my degradation i have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father and of this home made such a home by you has stirred old shadows that i thought had died out of me. since i knew you i have been troubled by a remorse that i thought would never reproach me again and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward that i thought were silent for ever. i have had unformed ideas of striving afresh beginning anew shaking off sloth and sensuality and fighting out the abandoned fight. a dream all a dream that ends in nothing and leaves the sleeper where he lay down but i wish you to know that you inspired it.  will nothing of it remain o mr. carton think again try again  no miss manette all through it i have known myself to be quite undeserving. and yet i have had the weakness and have still the weakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me heap of ashes that i am into firea fire however inseparable in its nature from myself quickening nothing lighting nothing doing no service idly burning away.  since it is my misfortune mr. carton to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me  dont say that miss manette for you would have reclaimed me if anything could. you will not be the cause of my becoming worse.  since the state of your mind that you describe is at all events attributable to some influence of minethis is what i mean if i can make it plaincan i use no influence to serve you have i no power for good with you at all  the utmost good that i am capable of now miss manette i have come here to realise. let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life the remembrance that i opened my heart to you last of all the world and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.  which i entreated you to believe again and again most fervently with all my heart was capable of better things mr. carton  entreat me to believe it no more miss manette. i have proved myself and i know better. i distress you i draw fast to an end. will you let me believe when i recall this day that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast and that it lies there alone and will be shared by no one  if that will be a consolation to you yes.  not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you  mr. carton she answered after an agitated pause the secret is yours not mine and i promise to respect it.  thank you. and again god bless you.  he put her hand to his lips and moved towards the door.  be under no apprehension miss manette of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word. i will never refer to it again. if i were dead that could not be surer than it is henceforth. in the hour of my death i shall hold sacred the one good remembranceand shall thank and bless you for itthat my last avowal of myself was made to you and that my name and faults and miseries were gently carried in your heart. may it otherwise be light and happy  he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away and how much he every day kept down and perverted that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her.  be comforted he said i am not worth such feeling miss manette. an hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to will render me less worth such tears as those than any wretch who creeps along the streets. be comforted but within myself i shall always be towards you what i am now though outwardly i shall be what you have heretofore seen me. the last supplication but one i make to you is that you will believe this of me.  i will mr. carton.  my last supplication of all is this and with it i will relieve you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison and between whom and you there is an impassable space. it is useless to say it i know but it rises out of my soul. for you and for any dear to you i would do anything. if my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it i would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. try to hold me in your mind at some quiet times as ardent and sincere in this one thing. the time will come the time will not be long in coming when new ties will be formed about youties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adornthe dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. o miss manette when the little picture of a happy fathers face looks up in yours when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet think now and then that there is a man who would give his life to keep a life you love beside you  he said farewell said a last god bless you and left her.     chapter xiv. the honest tradesman   to the eyes of mr. jeremiah cruncher sitting on his stool in fleetstreet with his grisly urchin beside him a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. who could sit upon anything in fleetstreet during the busy hours of the day and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions one ever tending westward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sun both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down  with his straw in his mouth mr. cruncher sat watching the two streams like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one streamsaving that jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from tellsons side of the tides to the opposite shore. brief as such companionship was in every separate instance mr. cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. and it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose that he recruited his finances as just now observed.  time was when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place and mused in the sight of men. mr. cruncher sitting on a stool in a public place but not being a poet mused as little as possible and looked about him.  it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few and belated women few and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs. cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when an unusual concourse pouring down fleetstreet westward attracted his attention. looking that way mr. cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along and that there was popular objection to this funeral which engendered uproar.  young jerry said mr. cruncher turning to his offspring its a buryin.  hooroar father cried young jerry.  the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance. the elder gentleman took the cry so ill that he watched his opportunity and smote the young gentleman on the ear.  what dye mean what are you hooroaring at what do you want to conwey to your own father you young rip this boy is a getting too many for me said mr. cruncher surveying him. him and his hooroars dont let me hear no more of you or you shall feel some more of me. dye hear  i warnt doing no harm young jerry protested rubbing his cheek.  drop it then said mr. cruncher i wont have none of your no harms. get a top of that there seat and look at the crowd.  his son obeyed and the crowd approached they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach in which mourning coach there was only one mourner dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. the position appeared by no means to please him however with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach deriding him making grimaces at him and incessantly groaning and calling out yah spies tst yaha spies  with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.  funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr. cruncher he always pricked up his senses and became excited when a funeral passed tellsons. naturally therefore a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly and he asked of the first man who ran against him  what is it brother whats it about  i dont know said the man. spies yaha tst spies  he asked another man. who is it  i dont know returned the man clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour spies yaha tst tst spiies  at length a person better informed on the merits of the case tumbled against him and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one roger cly.  was he a spy asked mr. cruncher.  old bailey spy returned his informant. yaha tst yah old bailey spiiies  why to be sure exclaimed jerry recalling the trial at which he had assisted. ive seen him. dead is he  dead as mutton returned the other and cant be too dead. have em out there spies pull em out there spies  the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea that the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating the suggestion to have em out and to pull em out mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. on the crowds opening the coach doors the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment but he was so alert and made such good use of his time that in another moment he was scouring away up a byestreet after shedding his cloak hat long hatband white pockethandkerchief and other symbolical tears.  these the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded. they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. practical suggestions being much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. among the first of these volunteers was jerry cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of tellsons in the further corner of the mourning coach.  the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies but the river being alarmingly near and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief. the remodelled procession started with a chimneysweep driving the hearseadvised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under close inspection for the purposeand with a pieman also attended by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach. a bearleader a popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand and his bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.  thus with beerdrinking pipesmoking songroaring and infinite caricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting at every step and all the shops shutting up before it. its destination was the old church of saint pancras far off in the fields. it got there in course of time insisted on pouring into the burialground finally accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way and highly to its own satisfaction.  the dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual passersby as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them. chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. the transition to the sport of windowbreaking and thence to the plundering of publichouses was easy and natural. at last after several hours when sundry summerhouses had been pulled down and some arearailings had been torn up to arm the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the guards were coming. before this rumour the crowd gradually melted away and perhaps the guards came and perhaps they never came and this was the usual progress of a mob.  mr. cruncher did not assist at the closing sports but had remained behind in the churchyard to confer and condole with the undertakers. the place had a soothing influence on him. he procured a pipe from a neighbouring publichouse and smoked it looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.  jerry said mr. cruncher apostrophising himself in his usual way you see that there cly that day and you see with your own eyes that he was a young un and a straight made un.  having smoked his pipe out and ruminated a little longer he turned himself about that he might appear before the hour of closing on his station at tellsons. whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man is not so much to the purpose as that he made a short call upon his medical advisera distinguished surgeonon his way back.  young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest and reported no job in his absence. the bank closed the ancient clerks came out the usual watch was set and mr. cruncher and his son went home to tea.  now i tell you where it is said mr. cruncher to his wife on entering. if as a honest tradesman my wenturs goes wrong tonight i shall make sure that youve been praying again me and i shall work you for it just the same as if i seen you do it.  the dejected mrs. cruncher shook her head.  why youre at it afore my face said mr. cruncher with signs of angry apprehension.  i am saying nothing.  well then dont meditate nothing. you might as well flop as meditate. you may as well go again me one way as another. drop it altogether.  yes jerry.  yes jerry repeated mr. cruncher sitting down to tea. ah it is yes jerry. thats about it. you may say yes jerry.  mr. cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations but made use of them as people not unfrequently do to express general ironical dissatisfaction.  you and your yes jerry said mr. cruncher taking a bite out of his breadandbutter and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. ah i think so. i believe you.  you are going out tonight asked his decent wife when he took another bite.  yes i am.  may i go with you father asked his son briskly.  no you maynt. im a goingas your mother knowsa fishing. thats where im going to. going a fishing.  your fishingrod gets rayther rusty dont it father  never you mind.  shall you bring any fish home father  if i dont youll have short commons tomorrow returned that gentleman shaking his head thats questions enough for you i aint a going out till youve been long abed.  he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on mrs. cruncher and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage. with this view he urged his son to hold her in conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. the devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. it was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.  and mind you said mr. cruncher. no games tomorrow if i as a honest tradesman succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two none of your not touching of it and sticking to bread. if i as a honest tradesman am able to provide a little beer none of your declaring on water. when you go to rome do as rome does. rome will be a ugly customer to you if you dont. im your rome you know.  then he began grumbling again  with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink i dont know how scarce you maynt make the wittles and drink here by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. look at your boy he is yourn aint he hes as thin as a lath. do you call yourself a mother and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boy out  this touched young jerry on a tender place who adjured his mother to perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglected above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.  thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family until young jerry was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similar injunctions obeyed them. mr. cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one oclock. towards that small and ghostly hour he rose up from his chair took a key out of his pocket opened a locked cupboard and brought forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other fishing tackle of that nature. disposing these articles about him in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs. cruncher extinguished the light and went out.  young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed was not long after his father. under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the court followed out into the streets. he was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the door stood ajar all night.  impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to house fronts walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his honoured parent in view. the honoured parent steering northward had not gone far when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton and the two trudged on together.  within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a lonely road. another fisherman was picked up hereand that so silently that if young jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split himself into two.  the three went on and young jerry went on until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall surmounted by an iron railing. in the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which the wallthere risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one side. crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that young jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an iron gate. he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the third. they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay there a littlelistening perhaps. then they moved away on their hands and knees.  it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate which he did holding his breath. crouching down again in a corner there and looking in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large churchyard that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. they did not creep far before they stopped and stood upright. and then they began to fish.  they fished with a spade at first. presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off with his hair as stiff as his fathers.  but his longcherished desire to know more about these matters not only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again. they were still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate for the second time but now they seemed to have got a bite. there was a screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were strained as if by a weight. by slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it and came to the surface. young jerry very well knew what it would be but when he saw it and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open he was so frightened being new to the sight that he made off again and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.  he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath it being a spectral sort of race that he ran and one highly desirable to get to the end of. he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him and pictured as hopping on behind him bolt upright upon its narrow end always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to shun. it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too for while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boys kite without tail and wings. it hid in doorways too rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them up to its ears as if it were laughing. it got into shadows on the road and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. all this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. and even then it would not leave him but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair scrambled into bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on his breast when he fell asleep.  from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father in the family room. something had gone wrong with him at least so young jerry inferred from the circumstance of his holding mrs. cruncher by the ears and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of the bed.  i told you i would said mr. cruncher and i did.  jerry jerry jerry his wife implored.  you oppose yourself to the profit of the business said jerry and me and my partners suffer. you was to honour and obey why the devil dont you  i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested with tears.  is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business  you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry.  its enough for you retorted mr. cruncher to be the wife of a honest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didnt. a honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. call yourself a religious woman if youre a religious woman give me a irreligious one you have no more natral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has of a pile and similarly it must be knocked into you.  the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminated in the honest tradesmans kicking off his claysoiled boots and lying down at his length on the floor. after taking a timid peep at him lying on his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay down too and fell asleep again.  there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else. mr. cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an iron potlid by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs. cruncher in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace. he was brushed and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.  young jerry walking with the stool under his arm at his fathers side along sunny and crowded fleetstreet was a very different young jerry from him of the previous night running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. his cunning was fresh with the day and his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in fleetstreet and the city of london that fine morning.  father said young jerry as they walked along taking care to keep at arms length and to have the stool well between them whats a resurrectionman  mr. cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered how should i know  i thought you knowed everything father said the artless boy.  hem well returned mr. cruncher going on again and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play hes a tradesman.  whats his goods father asked the brisk young jerry.  his goods said mr. cruncher after turning it over in his mind is a branch of scientific goods.  persons bodies aint it father asked the lively boy.  i believe it is something of that sort said mr. cruncher.  oh father i should so like to be a resurrectionman when im quite growed up  mr. cruncher was soothed but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. it depends upon how you dewelop your talents. be careful to dewelop your talents and never to say no more than you can help to nobody and theres no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for. as young jerry thus encouraged went on a few yards in advance to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar mr. cruncher added to himself jerry you honest tradesman theres hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you and a recompense to you for his mother     chapter xv. knitting   there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wineshop of monsieur defarge. as early as six oclock in the morning sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within bending over measures of wine. monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. a sour wine moreover or a souring for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur defarge but a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark lay hidden in the dregs of it.  this had been the third morning in succession on which there had been early drinking at the wineshop of monsieur defarge. it had begun on monday and here was wednesday come. there had been more of early brooding than drinking for many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. these were to the full as interested in the place however as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine and they glided from seat to seat and from corner to corner swallowing talk in lieu of drink with greedy looks.  notwithstanding an unusual flow of company the master of the wineshop was not visible. he was not missed for nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him nobody asked for him nobody wondered to see only madame defarge in her seat presiding over the distribution of wine with a bowl of battered small coins before her as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.  a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wineshop as they looked in at every place high and low from the kings palace to the criminals gaol. games at cards languished players at dominoes musingly built towers with them drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.  thus saint antoine in this vinous feature of his until midday. it was high noontide when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps of whom one was monsieur defarge the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. all adust and athirst the two entered the wineshop. their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of saint antoine fast spreading as they came along which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. yet no one had followed them and no man spoke when they entered the wineshop though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.  good day gentlemen said monsieur defarge.  it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. it elicited an answering chorus of good day  it is bad weather gentlemen said defarge shaking his head.  upon which every man looked at his neighbour and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. except one man who got up and went out.  my wife said defarge aloud addressing madame defarge i have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads called jacques. i met himby accidenta day and halfs journey out of paris. he is a good child this mender of roads called jacques. give him to drink my wife  a second man got up and went out. madame defarge set wine before the mender of roads called jacques who doffed his blue cap to the company and drank. in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread he ate of this between whiles and sat munching and drinking near madame defarges counter. a third man got up and went out.  defarge refreshed himself with a draught of winebut he took less than was given to the stranger as being himself a man to whom it was no rarityand stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. he looked at no one present and no one now looked at him not even madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and was at work.  have you finished your repast friend he asked in due season.  yes thank you.  come then you shall see the apartment that i told you you could occupy. it will suit you to a marvel.  out of the wineshop into the street out of the street into a courtyard out of the courtyard up a steep staircase out of the staircase into a garretformerly the garret where a whitehaired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes.  no whitehaired man was there now but the three men were there who had gone out of the wineshop singly. and between them and the whitehaired man afar off was the one small link that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.  defarge closed the door carefully and spoke in a subdued voice  jacques one jacques two jacques three this is the witness encountered by appointment by me jacques four. he will tell you all. speak jacques five  the mender of roads blue cap in hand wiped his swarthy forehead with it and said where shall i commence monsieur  commence was monsieur defarges not unreasonable reply at the commencement.  i saw him then messieurs began the mender of roads a year ago this running summer underneath the carriage of the marquis hanging by the chain. behold the manner of it. i leaving my work on the road the sun going to bed the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill he hanging by the chainlike this.  again the mender of roads went through the whole performance in which he ought to have been perfect by that time seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.  jacques one struck in and asked if he had ever seen the man before  never answered the mender of roads recovering his perpendicular.  jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then  by his tall figure said the mender of roads softly and with his finger at his nose. when monsieur the marquis demands that evening say what is he like i make response tall as a spectre.  you should have said short as a dwarf returned jacques two.  but what did i know the deed was not then accomplished neither did he confide in me. observe under those circumstances even i do not offer my testimony. monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger standing near our little fountain and says to me bring that rascal my faith messieurs i offer nothing.  he is right there jacques murmured defarge to him who had interrupted. go on  good said the mender of roads with an air of mystery. the tall man is lost and he is soughthow many months nine ten eleven  no matter the number said defarge. he is well hidden but at last he is unluckily found. go on  i am again at work upon the hillside and the sun is again about to go to bed. i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below where it is already dark when i raise my eyes and see coming over the hill six soldiers. in the midst of them is a tall man with his arms boundtied to his sideslike this  with the aid of his indispensable cap he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips with cords that were knotted behind him.  i stand aside messieurs by my heap of stones to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road that where any spectacle is well worth looking at and at first as they approach i see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound and that they are almost black to my sightexcept on the side of the sun going to bed where they have a red edge messieurs. also i see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road and are on the hill above it and are like the shadows of giants. also i see that they are covered with dust and that the dust moves with them as they come tramp tramp but when they advance quite near to me i recognise the tall man and he recognises me. ah but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hillside once again as on the evening when he and i first encountered close to the same spot  he described it as if he were there and it was evident that he saw it vividly perhaps he had not seen much in his life.  i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me we do it and we know it with our eyes. come on says the chief of that company pointing to the village bring him fast to his tomb and they bring him faster. i follow. his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight his wooden shoes are large and clumsy and he is lame. because he is lame and consequently slow they drive him with their gunslike this  he imitated the action of a mans being impelled forward by the buttends of muskets.  as they descend the hill like madmen running a race he falls. they laugh and pick him up again. his face is bleeding and covered with dust but he cannot touch it thereupon they laugh again. they bring him into the village all the village runs to look they take him past the mill and up to the prison all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night and swallow himlike this  he opened his mouth as wide as he could and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again defarge said go on jacques.  all the village pursued the mender of roads on tiptoe and in a low voice withdraws all the village whispers by the fountain all the village sleeps all the village dreams of that unhappy one within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag and never to come out of it except to perish. in the morning with my tools upon my shoulder eating my morsel of black bread as i go i make a circuit by the prison on my way to my work. there i see him high up behind the bars of a lofty iron cage bloody and dusty as last night looking through. he has no hand free to wave to me i dare not call to him he regards me like a dead man.  defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. the looks of all of them were dark repressed and revengeful as they listened to the countrymans story the manner of all of them while it was secret was authoritative too. they had the air of a rough tribunal jacques one and two sitting on the old palletbed each with his chin resting on his hand and his eyes intent on the roadmender jacques three equally intent on one knee behind them with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose defarge standing between them and the narrator whom he had stationed in the light of the window by turns looking from him to them and from them to him.  go on jacques said defarge.  he remains up there in his iron cage some days. the village looks at him by stealth for it is afraid. but it always looks up from a distance at the prison on the crag and in the evening when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain all faces are turned towards the prison. formerly they were turned towards the postinghouse now they are turned towards the prison. they whisper at the fountain that although condemned to death he will not be executed they say that petitions have been presented in paris showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child they say that a petition has been presented to the king himself. what do i know it is possible. perhaps yes perhaps no.  listen then jacques number one of that name sternly interposed. know that a petition was presented to the king and queen. all here yourself excepted saw the king take it in his carriage in the street sitting beside the queen. it is defarge whom you see here who at the hazard of his life darted out before the horses with the petition in his hand.  and once again listen jacques said the kneeling number three his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves with a strikingly greedy air as if he hungered for somethingthat was neither food nor drink the guard horse and foot surrounded the petitioner and struck him blows. you hear  i hear messieurs.  go on then said defarge.  again on the other hand they whisper at the fountain resumed the countryman that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot and that he will very certainly be executed. they even whisper that because he has slain monseigneur and because monseigneur was the father of his tenantsserfswhat you willhe will be executed as a parricide. one old man says at the fountain that his right hand armed with the knife will be burnt off before his face that into wounds which will be made in his arms his breast and his legs there will be poured boiling oil melted lead hot resin wax and sulphur finally that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. that old man says all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late king louis fifteen. but how do i know if he lies i am not a scholar.  listen once again then jacques said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. the name of that prisoner was damiens and it was all done in open day in the open streets of this city of paris and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion who were full of eager attention to the lastto the last jacques prolonged until nightfall when he had lost two legs and an arm and still breathed and it was donewhy how old are you  thirtyfive said the mender of roads who looked sixty.  it was done when you were more than ten years old you might have seen it.  enough said defarge with grim impatience. long live the devil go on.  well some whisper this some whisper that they speak of nothing else even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. at length on sunday night when all the village is asleep come soldiers winding down from the prison and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. workmen dig workmen hammer soldiers laugh and sing in the morning by the fountain there is raised a gallows forty feet high poisoning the water.  the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.  all work is stopped all assemble there nobody leads the cows out the cows are there with the rest. at midday the roll of drums. soldiers have marched into the prison in the night and he is in the midst of many soldiers. he is bound as before and in his mouth there is a gagtied so with a tight string making him look almost as if he laughed. he suggested it by creasing his face with his two thumbs from the corners of his mouth to his ears. on the top of the gallows is fixed the knife blade upwards with its point in the air. he is hanged there forty feet highand is left hanging poisoning the water.  they looked at one another as he used his blue cap to wipe his face on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle.  it is frightful messieurs. how can the women and the children draw water who can gossip of an evening under that shadow under it have i said when i left the village monday evening as the sun was going to bed and looked back from the hill the shadow struck across the church across the mill across the prisonseemed to strike across the earth messieurs to where the sky rests upon it  the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.  thats all messieurs. i left at sunset as i had been warned to do and i walked on that night and half next day until i met as i was warned i should this comrade. with him i came on now riding and now walking through the rest of yesterday and through last night. and here you see me  after a gloomy silence the first jacques said good you have acted and recounted faithfully. will you wait for us a little outside the door  very willingly said the mender of roads. whom defarge escorted to the top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned.  the three had risen and their heads were together when he came back to the garret.  how say you jacques demanded number one. to be registered  to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge.  magnificent croaked the man with the craving.  the chateau and all the race inquired the first.  the chateau and all the race returned defarge. extermination.  the hungry man repeated in a rapturous croak magnificent and began gnawing another finger.  are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register without doubt it is safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it but shall we always be able to decipher itor i ought to say will she  jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would not lose a word of itnot a syllable of it. knitted in her own stitches and her own symbols it will always be as plain to her as the sun. confide in madame defarge. it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives to erase himself from existence than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge.  there was a murmur of confidence and approval and then the man who hungered asked is this rustic to be sent back soon i hope so. he is very simple is he not a little dangerous  he knows nothing said defarge at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. i charge myself with him let him remain with me i will take care of him and set him on his road. he wishes to see the fine worldthe king the queen and court let him see them on sunday.  what exclaimed the hungry man staring. is it a good sign that he wishes to see royalty and nobility  jacques said defarge judiciously show a cat milk if you wish her to thirst for it. judiciously show a dog his natural prey if you wish him to bring it down one day.  nothing more was said and the mender of roads being found already dozing on the topmost stair was advised to lay himself down on the palletbed and take some rest. he needed no persuasion and was soon asleep.  worse quarters than defarges wineshop could easily have been found in paris for a provincial slave of that degree. saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted his life was very new and agreeable. but madame sat all day at her counter so expressly unconscious of him and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. for he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.  therefore when sunday came the mender of roads was not enchanted though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to versailles. it was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there in a public conveyance it was additionally disconcerting yet to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen.  you work hard madame said a man near her.  yes answered madame defarge i have a good deal to do.  what do you make madame  many things.  for instance  for instance returned madame defarge composedly shrouds.  the man moved a little further away as soon as he could and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap feeling it mightily close and oppressive. if he needed a king and queen to restore him he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand for soon the largefaced king and the fairfaced queen came in their golden coach attended by the shining bulls eye of their court a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes the mender of roads bathed himself so much to his temporary intoxication that he cried long live the king long live the queen long live everybody and everything as if he had never heard of ubiquitous jacques in his time. then there were gardens courtyards terraces fountains green banks more king and queen more bulls eye more lords and ladies more long live they all until he absolutely wept with sentiment. during the whole of this scene which lasted some three hours he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company and throughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.  bravo said defarge clapping him on the back when it was over like a patron you are a good boy  the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations but no.  you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear you make these fools believe that it will last for ever. then they are the more insolent and it is the nearer ended.  hey cried the mender of roads reflectively thats true.  these fools know nothing. while they despise your breath and would stop it for ever and ever in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs they only know what your breath tells them. let it deceive them then a little longer it cannot deceive them too much.  madame defarge looked superciliously at the client and nodded in confirmation.  as to you said she you would shout and shed tears for anything if it made a show and a noise. say would you not  truly madame i think so. for the moment.  if you were shown a great heap of dolls and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage you would pick out the richest and gayest. say would you not  truly yes madame.  yes. and if you were shown a flock of birds unable to fly and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers would you not  it is true madame.  you have seen both dolls and birds today said madame defarge with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent now go home     chapter xvi. still knitting   madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to the whispering trees. such ample leisure had the stone faces now for listening to the trees and to the fountain that the few village scarecrows who in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. a rumour just lived in the villagehad a faint and bare existence there as its people hadthat when the knife struck home the faces changed from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain also that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain they changed again and bore a cruel look of being avenged which they would henceforth bear for ever. in the stone face over the great window of the bedchamber where the murder was done two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose which everybody recognised and which nobody had seen of old and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute before they all started away among the moss and leaves like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.  chateau and hut stone face and dangling figure the red stain on the stone floor and the pure water in the village wellthousands of acres of landa whole province of franceall france itselflay under the night sky concentrated into a faint hairbreadth line. so does a whole world with all its greatnesses and littlenesses lie in a twinkling star. and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition so sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours every thought and act every vice and virtue of every responsible creature on it.  the defarges husband and wife came lumbering under the starlight in their public vehicle to that gate of paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. there was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry. monsieur defarge alighted knowing one or two of the soldiery there and one of the police. the latter he was intimate with and affectionately embraced.  when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings and they having finally alighted near the saints boundaries were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets madame defarge spoke to her husband  say then my friend what did jacques of the police tell thee  very little tonight but all he knows. there is another spy commissioned for our quarter. there may be many more for all that he can say but he knows of one.  eh well said madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a cool business air. it is necessary to register him. how do they call that man  he is english.  so much the better. his name  barsad said defarge making it french by pronunciation. but he had been so careful to get it accurately that he then spelt it with perfect correctness.  barsad repeated madame. good. christian name  john.  john barsad repeated madame after murmuring it once to herself. good. his appearance is it known  age about forty years height about five feet nine black hair complexion dark generally rather handsome visage eyes dark face thin long and sallow nose aquiline but not straight having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek expression therefore sinister.  eh my faith. it is a portrait said madame laughing. he shall be registered tomorrow.  they turned into the wineshop which was closed for it was midnight and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence examined the stock went through the entries in the book made other entries of her own checked the serving man in every possible way and finally dismissed him to bed. then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time and began knotting them up in her handkerchief in a chain of separate knots for safe keeping through the night. all this while defarge with his pipe in his mouth walked up and down complacently admiring but never interfering in which condition indeed as to the business and his domestic affairs he walked up and down through life.  the night was hot and the shop close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood was illsmelling. monsieur defarges olfactory sense was by no means delicate but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. he whiffed the compound of scents away as he put down his smokedout pipe.  you are fatigued said madame raising her glance as she knotted the money. there are only the usual odours.  i am a little tired her husband acknowledged.  you are a little depressed too said madame whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts but they had had a ray or two for him. oh the men the men  but my dear began defarge.  but my dear repeated madame nodding firmly but my dear you are faint of heart tonight my dear  well then said defarge as if a thought were wrung out of his breast it is a long time.  it is a long time repeated his wife and when is it not a long time vengeance and retribution require a long time it is the rule.  it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning said defarge.  how long demanded madame composedly does it take to make and store the lightning tell me.  defarge raised his head thoughtfully as if there were something in that too.  it does not take a long time said madame for an earthquake to swallow a town. eh well tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake  a long time i suppose said defarge.  but when it is ready it takes place and grinds to pieces everything before it. in the meantime it is always preparing though it is not seen or heard. that is your consolation. keep it.  she tied a knot with flashing eyes as if it throttled a foe.  i tell thee said madame extending her right hand for emphasis that although it is a long time on the road it is on the road and coming. i tell thee it never retreats and never stops. i tell thee it is always advancing. look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know consider the faces of all the world that we know consider the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour. can such things last bah i mock you.  my brave wife returned defarge standing before her with his head a little bent and his hands clasped at his back like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist i do not question all this. but it has lasted a long time and it is possibleyou know well my wife it is possiblethat it may not come during our lives.  eh well how then demanded madame tying another knot as if there were another enemy strangled.  well said defarge with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug. we shall not see the triumph.  we shall have helped it returned madame with her extended hand in strong action. nothing that we do is done in vain. i believe with all my soul that we shall see the triumph. but even if not even if i knew certainly not show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant and still i would  then madame with her teeth set tied a very terrible knot indeed.  hold cried defarge reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice i too my dear will stop at nothing.  yes but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity to sustain you. sustain yourself without that. when the time comes let loose a tiger and a devil but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always ready.  madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner and observing that it was time to go to bed.  next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wineshop knitting away assiduously. a rose lay beside her and if she now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air. there were a few customers drinking or not drinking standing or seated sprinkled about. the day was very hot and heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame fell dead at the bottom. their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading who looked at them in the coolest manner as if they themselves were elephants or something as far removed until they met the same fate. curious to consider how heedless flies areperhaps they thought as much at court that sunny summer day.  a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one. she laid down her knitting and began to pin her rose in her headdress before she looked at the figure.  it was curious. the moment madame defarge took up the rose the customers ceased talking and began gradually to drop out of the wineshop.  good day madame said the newcomer.  good day monsieur.  she said it aloud but added to herself as she resumed her knitting hah good day age about forty height about five feet nine black hair generally rather handsome visage complexion dark eyes dark thin long and sallow face aquiline nose but not straight having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression good day one and all  have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac and a mouthful of cool fresh water madame.  madame complied with a polite air.  marvellous cognac this madame  it was the first time it had ever been so complimented and madame defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. she said however that the cognac was flattered and took up her knitting. the visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and took the opportunity of observing the place in general.  you knit with great skill madame.  i am accustomed to it.  a pretty pattern too  you think so said madame looking at him with a smile.  decidedly. may one ask what it is for  pastime said madame still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly.  not for use  that depends. i may find a use for it one day. if i dowell said madame drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry ill use it  it was remarkable but the taste of saint antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the headdress of madame defarge. two men had entered separately and had been about to order drink when catching sight of that novelty they faltered made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there and went away. nor of those who had been there when this visitor entered was there one left. they had all dropped off. the spy had kept his eyes open but had been able to detect no sign. they had lounged away in a povertystricken purposeless accidental manner quite natural and unimpeachable.  john thought madame checking off her work as her fingers knitted and her eyes looked at the stranger. stay long enough and i shall knit barsad before you go.  you have a husband madame  i have.  children  no children.  business seems bad  business is very bad the people are so poor.  ah the unfortunate miserable people so oppressed tooas you say.  as you say madame retorted correcting him and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.  pardon me certainly it was i who said so but you naturally think so. of course.  i think returned madame in a high voice. i and my husband have enough to do to keep this wineshop open without thinking. all we think here is how to live. that is the subject we think of and it gives us from morning to night enough to think about without embarrassing our heads concerning others. i think for others no no.  the spy who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face but stood with an air of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbow on madame defarges little counter and occasionally sipping his cognac.  a bad business this madame of gaspards execution. ah the poor gaspard with a sigh of great compassion.  my faith returned madame coolly and lightly if people use knives for such purposes they have to pay for it. he knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was he has paid the price.  i believe said the spy dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face i believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood touching the poor fellow between ourselves.  is there asked madame vacantly.  is there not  here is my husband said madame defarge.  as the keeper of the wineshop entered at the door the spy saluted him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smile good day jacques defarge stopped short and stared at him.  good day jacques the spy repeated with not quite so much confidence or quite so easy a smile under the stare.  you deceive yourself monsieur returned the keeper of the wineshop. you mistake me for another. that is not my name. i am ernest defarge.  it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited too good day  good day answered defarge drily.  i was saying to madame with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when you entered that they tell me there isand no wondermuch sympathy and anger in saint antoine touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard.  no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head. i know nothing of it.  having said it he passed behind the little counter and stood with his hand on the back of his wifes chair looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.  the spy well used to his business did not change his unconscious attitude but drained his little glass of cognac took a sip of fresh water and asked for another glass of cognac. madame defarge poured it out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a little song over it.  you seem to know this quarter well that is to say better than i do  observed defarge.  not at all but i hope to know it better. i am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.  hah muttered defarge.  the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls to me  pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.  indeed said defarge with much indifference.  yes indeed. when doctor manette was released you his old domestic had the charge of him i know. he was delivered to you. you see i am informed of the circumstances  such is the fact certainly said defarge. he had had it conveyed to him in an accidental touch of his wifes elbow as she knitted and warbled that he would do best to answer but always with brevity.  it was to you said the spy that his daughter came and it was from your care that his daughter took him accompanied by a neat brown monsieur how is he calledin a little wiglorryof the bank of tellson and companyover to england.  such is the fact repeated defarge.  very interesting remembrances said the spy. i have known doctor manette and his daughter in england.  yes said defarge.  you dont hear much about them now said the spy.  no said defarge.  in effect madame struck in looking up from her work and her little song we never hear about them. we received the news of their safe arrival and perhaps another letter or perhaps two but since then they have gradually taken their road in lifewe oursand we have held no correspondence.  perfectly so madame replied the spy. she is going to be married.  going echoed madame. she was pretty enough to have been married long ago. you english are cold it seems to me.  oh you know i am english.  i perceive your tongue is returned madame and what the tongue is i suppose the man is.  he did not take the identification as a compliment but he made the best of it and turned it off with a laugh. after sipping his cognac to the end he added  yes miss manette is going to be married. but not to an englishman to one who like herself is french by birth. and speaking of gaspard ah poor gaspard it was cruel cruel it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis for whom gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet in other words the present marquis. but he lives unknown in england he is no marquis there he is mr. charles darnay. daulnais is the name of his mothers family.  madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. do what he would behind the little counter as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe he was troubled and his hand was not trustworthy. the spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it or to record it in his mind.  having made at least this one hit whatever it might prove to be worth and no customers coming in to help him to any other mr. barsad paid for what he had drunk and took his leave taking occasion to say in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again. for some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them lest he should come back.  can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair what he has said of maamselle manette  as he has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a little it is probably false. but it may be true.  if it is defarge began and stopped.  if it is repeated his wife.  and if it does come while we live to see it triumphi hope for her sake destiny will keep her husband out of france.  her husbands destiny said madame defarge with her usual composure will take him where he is to go and will lead him to the end that is to end him. that is all i know.  but it is very strangenow at least is it not very strangesaid defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it that after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herself her husbands name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment by the side of that infernal dogs who has just left us  stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered madame. i have them both here of a certainty and they are both here for their merits that is enough.  she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head. either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone or saint antoine was on the watch for its disappearance howbeit the saint took courage to lounge in very shortly afterwards and the wineshop recovered its habitual aspect.  in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turned himself inside out and sat on doorsteps and windowledges and came to the corners of vile streets and courts for a breath of air madame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group a missionarythere were many like hersuch as the world will do well never to breed again. all the women knitted. they knitted worthless things but the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus if the bony fingers had been still the stomachs would have been more faminepinched.  but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts. and as madame defarge moved on from group to group all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with and left behind.  her husband smoked at his door looking after her with admiration. a great woman said he a strong woman a grand woman a frightfully grand woman  darkness closed around and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard as the women sat knitting knitting. darkness encompassed them. another darkness was closing in as surely when the church bells then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france should be melted into thundering cannon when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty freedom and life. so much was closing in about the women who sat knitting knitting that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt where they were to sit knitting knitting counting dropping heads.     chapter xvii. one night   never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in soho than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat under the planetree together. never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great london than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree and shone upon their faces through its leaves.  lucie was to be married tomorrow. she had reserved this last evening for her father and they sat alone under the planetree.  you are happy my dear father  quite my child.  they had said little though they had been there a long time. when it was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself in her usual work nor had she read to him. she had employed herself in both ways at his side under the tree many and many a time but this time was not quite like any other and nothing could make it so.  and i am very happy tonight dear father. i am deeply happy in the love that heaven has so blessedmy love for charles and charless love for me. but if my life were not to be still consecrated to you or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us even by the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappy and selfreproachful now than i can tell you. even as it is  even as it was she could not command her voice.  in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face upon his breast. in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and its going.  dearest dear can you tell me this last time that you feel quite quite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine will ever interpose between us i know it well but do you know it in your own heart do you feel quite certain  her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed quite sure my darling more than that he added as he tenderly kissed her my future is far brighter lucie seen through your marriage than it could have beennay than it ever waswithout it.  if i could hope that my father  believe it love indeed it is so. consider how natural and how plain it is my dear that it should be so. you devoted and young cannot fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be wasted  she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his and repeated the word.  wasted my childshould not be wasted struck aside from the natural order of thingsfor my sake. your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this but only ask yourself how could my happiness be perfect while yours was incomplete  if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quite happy with you.  he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without charles having seen him and replied  my child you did see him and it is charles. if it had not been charles it would have been another. or if it had been no other i should have been the cause and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you.  it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering. it gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears and she remembered it long afterwards.  see said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards the moon. i have looked at her from my prisonwindow when i could not bear her light. i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beaten my head against my prisonwalls. i have looked at her in a state so dull and lethargic that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i could draw across her at the full and the number of perpendicular lines with which i could intersect them. he added in his inward and pondering manner as he looked at the moon it was twenty either way i remember and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.  the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time deepened as he dwelt upon it but there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference. he only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.  i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom i had been rent. whether it was alive. whether it had been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it. whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father. there was a time in my imprisonment when my desire for vengeance was unbearable. whether it was a son who would never know his fathers story who might even live to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own will and act. whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.  she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand.  i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful of merather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me. i have cast up the years of her age year after year. i have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. i have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living and in the next generation my place was a blank.  my father even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child.  you lucie it is out of the consolation and restoration you have brought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and the moon on this last night.what did i say just now  she knew nothing of you. she cared nothing for you.  so but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain for its foundations couldi have imagined her as coming to me in my cell and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. i have seen her image in the moonlight often as i now see you except that i never held her in my arms it stood between the little grated window and the door. but you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of  the figure was not thetheimage the fancy  no. that was another thing. it stood before my disturbed sense of sight but it never moved. the phantom that my mind pursued was another and more real child. of her outward appearance i know no more than that she was like her mother. the other had that likeness tooas you havebut was not the same. can you follow me lucie hardly i think i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.  his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.  in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlight coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. my picture was in her room and i was in her prayers. her life was active cheerful useful but my poor history pervaded it all.  i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my love that was i.  and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvais and they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me. when they passed a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning walls and looked up at its bars and spoke in whispers. she could never deliver me i imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things. but then blessed with the relief of tears i fell upon my knees and blessed her.  i am that child i hope my father. o my dear my dear will you bless me as fervently tomorrow  lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have tonight for loving you better than words can tell and thanking god for my great happiness. my thoughts when they were wildest never rose near the happiness that i have known with you and that we have before us.  he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humbly thanked heaven for having bestowed her on him. byandbye they went into the house.  there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr. lorry there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross. the marriage was to make no change in their place of residence they had been able to extend it by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothing more.  doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper. they were only three at table and miss pross made the third. he regretted that charles was not there was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away and drank to him affectionately.  so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and they separated. but in the stillness of the third hour of the morning lucie came downstairs again and stole into his room not free from unshaped fears beforehand.  all things however were in their places all was quiet and he lay asleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet. she put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips to his then leaned over him and looked at him.  into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had worn but he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep. a more remarkable face in its quiet resolute and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep that night.  she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be and as his sorrows deserved. then she withdrew her hand and kissed his lips once more and went away. so the sunrise came and the shadows of the leaves of the planetree moved upon his face as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.     chapter xviii. nine days   the marriageday was shining brightly and they were ready outside the closed door of the doctors room where he was speaking with charles darnay. they were ready to go to church the beautiful bride mr. lorry and miss prossto whom the event through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable would have been one of absolute bliss but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should have been the bridegroom.  and so said mr. lorry who could not sufficiently admire the bride and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet pretty dress and so it was for this my sweet lucie that i brought you across the channel such a baby lord bless me how little i thought what i was doing how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring on my friend mr. charles  you didnt mean it remarked the matteroffact miss pross and therefore how could you know it nonsense  really well but dont cry said the gentle mr. lorry.  i am not crying said miss pross you are.  i my pross by this time mr. lorry dared to be pleasant with her on occasion.  you were just now i saw you do it and i dont wonder at it. such a present of plate as you have made em is enough to bring tears into anybodys eyes. theres not a fork or a spoon in the collection said miss pross that i didnt cry over last night after the box came till i couldnt see it.  i am highly gratified said mr. lorry though upon my honour i had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. dear me this is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. dear dear dear to think that there might have been a mrs. lorry any time these fifty years almost  not at all from miss pross.  you think there never might have been a mrs. lorry asked the gentleman of that name.  pooh rejoined miss pross you were a bachelor in your cradle.  well observed mr. lorry beamingly adjusting his little wig that seems probable too.  and you were cut out for a bachelor pursued miss pross before you were put in your cradle.  then i think said mr. lorry that i was very unhandsomely dealt with and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern. enough now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly round her waist i hear them moving in the next room and miss pross and i as two formal folks of business are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. you leave your good father my dear in hands as earnest and as loving as your own he shall be taken every conceivable care of during the next fortnight while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts even tellsons shall go to the wall comparatively speaking before him. and when at the fortnights end he comes to join you and your beloved husband on your other fortnights trip in wales you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. now i hear somebodys step coming to the door. let me kiss my dear girl with an oldfashioned bachelor blessing before somebody comes to claim his own.  for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at the wellremembered expression on the forehead and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which if such things be oldfashioned were as old as adam.  the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles darnay. he was so deadly palewhich had not been the case when they went in togetherthat no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered except that to the shrewd glance of mr. lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him like a cold wind.  he gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to the chariot which mr. lorry had hired in honour of the day. the rest followed in another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married.  besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr. lorrys pockets. they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting.  it was a hard parting though it was not for long. but her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms take her charles she is yours  and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone.  the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr. lorry and miss pross were left quite alone. it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr. lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow.  he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. but it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr. lorry and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got upstairs mr. lorry was reminded of defarge the wineshop keeper and the starlight ride.  i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him. i must look in at tellsons so i will go there at once and come back presently. then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well.  it was easier for mr. lorry to look in at tellsons than to look out of tellsons. he was detained two hours. when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctors rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.  good god he said with a start. whats that  miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear. o me o me all is lost cried she wringing her hands. what is to be told to ladybird he doesnt know me and is making shoes  mr. lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the doctors room. the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy.  doctor manette. my dear friend doctor manette  the doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again.  he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him. he worked hardimpatientlyas if in some sense of having been interrupted.  mr. lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was.  a young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking up. it ought to have been finished long ago. let it be.  but doctor manette. look at me  he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work.  you know me my dear friend think again. this is not your proper occupation. think dear friend  nothing would induce him to speak more. he looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him. he worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air. the only ray of hope that mr. lorry could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.  two things at once impressed themselves on mr. lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. in conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest. in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.  these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr. lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. if that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the doctors case.  in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable mr. lorry resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so. he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room.  he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried. he abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling. he remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place.  doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to seeworked on half an hour after mr. lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write. when he put his tools aside as useless until morning mr. lorry rose and said to him  will you go out  he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice  out  yes for a walk with me. why not  he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more. but mr. lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it.  miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep. in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work.  on this second day mr. lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. he returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly. this encouraged mr. lorry to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss. this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr. lorrys friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.  when it fell dark again mr. lorry asked him as before  dear doctor will you go out  as before he repeated out  yes for a walk with me. why not  this time mr. lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned. in the meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the planetree but on mr. lorrys return he slipped away to his bench.  the time went very slowly on and mr. lorrys hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. the third day came and went the fourth the fifth. five days six days seven days eight days nine days.  with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier mr. lorry passed through this anxious time. the secret was well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening.     chapter xix. an opinion   worn out by anxious watching mr. lorry fell asleep at his post. on the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.  he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep. for going to the door of the doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window. he was in his usual morning dress and his face which mr. lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive.  even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr. lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened  it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious. if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor manettes consultingroom and to be debating these points outside the doctors bedroom door in the early morning  within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side. if he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clearheaded and had none. he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfasthour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr. lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain.  miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care. having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette mr. lorry presented himself at the breakfasthour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg. the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast.  so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr. lorry felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken place yesterday. an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy. in all other respects however he was so composedly himself that mr. lorry determined to have the aid he sought. and that aid was his own.  therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the doctor were left together mr. lorry said feelingly  my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so.  glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the doctor looked troubled and listened attentively. he had already glanced at his hands more than once.  doctor manette said mr. lorry touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sakeand above all for his daughtershis daughters my dear manette.  if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock  yes  be explicit said the doctor. spare no detail.  mr. lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded.  my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings thetheas you express itthe mind. the mind. it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it. it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himselfas i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large. but unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse.  the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration  nine days and nights.  how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock  that is the fact.  now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally  once.  and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respectsor in all respectsas he was then  i think in all respects.  you spoke of his daughter. does his daughter know of the relapse  no. it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her. it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted.  the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind. that was very thoughtful mr. lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while.  now my dear manette said mr. lorry at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. i do not possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of intelligence i want guiding. there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance as on you. tell me how does this relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine if i knew how.  but i dont know how to originate in such a case. if your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little. pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful.  doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and mr. lorry did not press him.  i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject.  was it dreaded by him mr. lorry ventured to ask.  very much. he said it with an involuntary shudder.  you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.  would he asked mr. lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him  i think so. but it is as i have told you next to impossible. i even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible.  now said mr. lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack  i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady. some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled i think. it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalledsay under certain circumstancessay on a particular occasion. he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.  would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr. lorry with natural hesitation.  the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice not at all.  now as to the future hinted mr. lorry.  as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have great hope. as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope. he yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that the worst was over.  well well thats good comfort. i am thankful said mr. lorry.  i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence.  there are two other points said mr. lorry on which i am anxious to be instructed. i may go on  you cannot do your friend a better service. the doctor gave him his hand.  to the first then. he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things. now does he do too much  i think not. it may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation. that may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction. the less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. he may have observed himself and made the discovery.  you are sure that he is not under too great a strain  i think i am quite sure of it.  my dear manette if he were overworked now  my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be. there has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight.  excuse me as a persistent man of business. assuming for a moment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder  i do not think so. i do not think said doctor manette with the firmness of selfconviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it. i think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. after what has happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again. i trust and i almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.  he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress. it was not for his friend to abate that confidence. he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point. he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it.  the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said mr. lorry clearing his throat we will callblacksmiths work blacksmiths work. we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge. we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. is it not a pity that he should keep it by him  the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground.  he has always kept it by him said mr. lorry with an anxious look at his friend. now would it not be better that he should let it go  still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground.  you do not find it easy to advise me said mr. lorry. i quite understand it to be a nice question. and yet i think and there he shook his head and stopped.  you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor mans mind. he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. even now when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.  he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to mr. lorrys face.  but may notmind i ask for information as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and banknotesmay not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go with it in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the forge  there was another silence.  you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old companion.  i would not keep it said mr. lorry shaking his head for he gained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted. i would recommend him to sacrifice it. i only want your authority. i am sure it does no good. come give me your authority like a dear good man. for his daughters sake my dear manette  very strange to see what a struggle there was within him  in her name then let it be done i sanction it. but i would not take it away while he was present. let it be removed when he is not there let him miss his old companion after an absence.  mr. lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended. they passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored. on the three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband. the precaution that had been taken to account for his silence mr. lorry had previously explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and she had no suspicions.  on the night of the day on which he left the house mr. lorry went into his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross carrying a light. there with closed doors and in a mysterious and guilty manner mr. lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure. the burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire and the tools shoes and leather were buried in the garden. so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds that mr. lorry and miss pross while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible crime.     chapter xx. a plea   when the newlymarried pair came home the first person who appeared to offer his congratulations was sydney carton. they had not been at home many hours when he presented himself. he was not improved in habits or in looks or in manner but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him which was new to the observation of charles darnay.  he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of speaking to him when no one overheard.  mr. darnay said carton i wish we might be friends.  we are already friends i hope.  you are good enough to say so as a fashion of speech but i dont mean any fashion of speech. indeed when i say i wish we might be friends i scarcely mean quite that either.  charles darnayas was naturalasked him in all goodhumour and goodfellowship what he did mean  upon my life said carton smiling i find that easier to comprehend in my own mind than to convey to yours. however let me try. you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk thanthan usual  i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.  i remember it too. the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for i always remember them. i hope it may be taken into account one day when all days are at an end for me dont be alarmed i am not going to preach.  i am not at all alarmed. earnestness in you is anything but alarming to me.  ah said carton with a careless wave of his hand as if he waved that away. on the drunken occasion in question one of a large number as you know i was insufferable about liking you and not liking you. i wish you would forget it.  i forgot it long ago.  fashion of speech again but mr. darnay oblivion is not so easy to me as you represent it to be to you. i have by no means forgotten it and a light answer does not help me to forget it.  if it was a light answer returned darnay i beg your forgiveness for it. i had no other object than to turn a slight thing which to my surprise seems to trouble you too much aside. i declare to you on the faith of a gentleman that i have long dismissed it from my mind. good heaven what was there to dismiss have i had nothing more important to remember in the great service you rendered me that day  as to the great service said carton i am bound to avow to you when you speak of it in that way that it was mere professional claptrap i dont know that i cared what became of you when i rendered it.mind i say when i rendered it i am speaking of the past.  you make light of the obligation returned darnay but i will not quarrel with your light answer.  genuine truth mr. darnay trust me i have gone aside from my purpose i was speaking about our being friends. now you know me you know i am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. if you doubt it ask stryver and hell tell you so.  i prefer to form my own opinion without the aid of his.  well at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has never done any good and never will.  i dont know that you never will.  but i do and you must take my word for it. well if you could endure to have such a worthless fellow and a fellow of such indifferent reputation coming and going at odd times i should ask that i might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here that i might be regarded as an useless and i would add if it were not for the resemblance i detected between you and me an unornamental piece of furniture tolerated for its old service and taken no notice of. i doubt if i should abuse the permission. it is a hundred to one if i should avail myself of it four times in a year. it would satisfy me i dare say to know that i had it.  will you try  that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have indicated. i thank you darnay. i may use that freedom with your name  i think so carton by this time.  they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away. within a minute afterwards he was to all outward appearance as unsubstantial as ever.  when he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with miss pross the doctor and mr. lorry charles darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms and spoke of sydney carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness. he spoke of him in short not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself.  he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.  we are thoughtful tonight said darnay drawing his arm about her.  yes dearest charles with her hands on his breast and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him we are rather thoughtful tonight for we have something on our mind tonight.  what is it my lucie  will you promise not to press one question on me if i beg you not to ask it  will i promise what will i not promise to my love  what indeed with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him  i think charles poor mr. carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him tonight.  indeed my own why so  that is what you are not to ask me. but i thinki knowhe does.  if you know it it is enough. what would you have me do my life  i would ask you dearest to be very generous with him always and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. i would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very very seldom reveals and that there are deep wounds in it. my dear i have seen it bleeding.  it is a painful reflection to me said charles darnay quite astounded that i should have done him any wrong. i never thought this of him.  my husband it is so. i fear he is not to be reclaimed there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. but i am sure that he is capable of good things gentle things even magnanimous things.  she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.  and o my dearest love she urged clinging nearer to him laying her head upon his breast and raising her eyes to his remember how strong we are in our happiness and how weak he is in his misery  the supplication touched him home. i will always remember it dear heart i will remember it as long as i live.  he bent over the golden head and put the rosy lips to his and folded her in his arms. if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets could have heard her innocent disclosure and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband he might have cried to the nightand the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time  god bless her for her sweet compassion     chapter xxi. echoing footsteps   a wonderful corner for echoes it has been remarked that corner where the doctor lived. ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband and her father and herself and her old directress and companion in a life of quiet bliss lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner listening to the echoing footsteps of years.  at first there were times though she was a perfectly happy young wife when her work would slowly fall from her hands and her eyes would be dimmed. for there was something coming in the echoes something light afar off and scarcely audible yet that stirred her heart too much. fluttering hopes and doubtshopes of a love as yet unknown to her doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy that new delightdivided her breast. among the echoes then there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate and who would mourn for her so much swelled to her eyes and broke like waves.  that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom. then among the advancing echoes there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words. let greater echoes resound as they would the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. they came and the shady house was sunny with a childs laugh and the divine friend of children to whom in her trouble she had confided hers seemed to take her child in his arms as he took the child of old and made it a sacred joy to her.  ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives and making it predominate nowhere lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. her husbands step was strong and prosperous among them her fathers firm and equal. lo miss pross in harness of string awakening the echoes as an unruly charger whipcorrected snorting and pawing the earth under the planetree in the garden  even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest they were not harsh nor cruel. even when golden hair like her own lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy and he said with a radiant smile dear papa and mamma i am very sorry to leave you both and to leave my pretty sister but i am called and i must go those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mothers cheek as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. suffer them and forbid them not. they see my fathers face. o father blessed words  thus the rustling of an angels wings got blended with the other echoes and they were not wholly of earth but had in them that breath of heaven. sighs of the winds that blew over a little gardentomb were mingled with them also and both were audible to lucie in a hushed murmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shoreas the little lucie comically studious at the task of the morning or dressing a doll at her mothers footstool chattered in the tongues of the two cities that were blended in her life.  the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton. some halfdozen times a year at most he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited and would sit among them through the evening as he had once done often. he never came there heated with wine. and one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.  no man ever really loved a woman lost her and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind when she was a wife and a mother but her children had a strange sympathy with himan instinctive delicacy of pity for him. what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case no echoes tell but it is so and it was so here. carton was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms and he kept his place with her as she grew. the little boy had spoken of him almost at the last. poor carton kiss him for me  mr. stryver shouldered his way through the law like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water and dragged his useful friend in his wake like a boat towed astern. as the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight and mostly under water so sydney had a swamped life of it. but easy and strong custom unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace made it the life he was to lead and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lions jackal than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion. stryver was rich had married a florid widow with property and three boys who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.  these three young gentlemen mr. stryver exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in soho and had offered as pupils to lucies husband delicately saying halloa here are three lumps of breadandcheese towards your matrimonial picnic darnay the polite rejection of the three lumps of breadandcheese had quite bloated mr. stryver with indignation which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen by directing them to beware of the pride of beggars like that tutorfellow. he was also in the habit of declaiming to mrs. stryver over his fullbodied wine on the arts mrs. darnay had once put in practice to catch him and on the diamondcutdiamond arts in himself madam which had rendered him not to be caught. some of his kings bench familiars who were occasionally parties to the fullbodied wine and the lie excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often that he believed it himselfwhich is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence as to justify any such offenders being carried off to some suitably retired spot and there hanged out of the way.  these were among the echoes to which lucie sometimes pensive sometimes amused and laughing listened in the echoing corner until her little daughter was six years old. how near to her heart the echoes of her childs tread came and those of her own dear fathers always active and selfpossessed and those of her dear husbands need not be told. nor how the lightest echo of their united home directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste was music to her. nor how there were echoes all about her sweet in her ears of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married if that could be than single and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him and asked her what is the magic secret my darling of your being everything to all of us as if there were only one of us yet never seeming to be hurried or to have too much to do  but there were other echoes from a distance that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time. and it was now about little lucies sixth birthday that they began to have an awful sound as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising.  on a night in midjuly one thousand seven hundred and eightynine mr. lorry came in late from tellsons and sat himself down by lucie and her husband in the dark window. it was a hot wild night and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.  i began to think said mr. lorry pushing his brown wig back that i should have to pass the night at tellsons. we have been so full of business all day that we have not known what to do first or which way to turn. there is such an uneasiness in paris that we have actually a run of confidence upon us our customers over there seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. there is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to england.  that has a bad look said darnay  a bad look you say my dear darnay yes but we dont know what reason there is in it. people are so unreasonable some of us at tellsons are getting old and we really cant be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.  still said darnay you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.  i know that to be sure assented mr. lorry trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured and that he grumbled but i am determined to be peevish after my long days botheration. where is manette  here he is said the doctor entering the dark room at the moment.  i am quite glad you are at home for these hurries and forebodings by which i have been surrounded all day long have made me nervous without reason. you are not going out i hope  no i am going to play backgammon with you if you like said the doctor.  i dont think i do like if i may speak my mind. i am not fit to be pitted against you tonight. is the teaboard still there lucie i cant see.  of course it has been kept for you.  thank ye my dear. the precious child is safe in bed  and sleeping soundly.  thats right all safe and well i dont know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here thank god but i have been so put out all day and i am not as young as i was my tea my dear thank ye. now come and take your place in the circle and let us sit quiet and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.  not a theory it was a fancy.  a fancy then my wise pet said mr. lorry patting her hand. they are very numerous and very loud though are they not only hear them  headlong mad and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybodys life footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red the footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off as the little circle sat in the dark london window.  saint antoine had been that morning a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. a tremendous roar arose from the throat of saint antoine and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below no matter how far off.  who gave them out whence they last came where they began through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked scores at a time over the heads of the crowd like a kind of lightning no eye in the throng could have told but muskets were being distributedso were cartridges powder and ball bars of iron and wood knives axes pikes every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. people who could lay hold of nothing else set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. every pulse and heart in saint antoine was on highfever strain and at highfever heat. every living creature there held life as of no account and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.  as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point so all this raging circled round defarges wineshop and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat issued orders issued arms thrust this man back dragged this man forward disarmed one to arm another laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.  keep near to me jacques three cried defarge and do you jacques one and two separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can. where is my wife  eh well here you see me said madame composed as ever but not knitting today. madames resolute right hand was occupied with an axe in place of the usual softer implements and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.  where do you go my wife  i go said madame with you at present. you shall see me at the head of women byandbye.  come then cried defarge in a resounding voice. patriots and friends we are ready the bastille  with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped into the detested word the living sea rose wave on wave depth on depth and overflowed the city to that point. alarmbells ringing drums beating the sea raging and thundering on its new beach the attack began.  deep ditches double drawbridge massive stone walls eight great towers cannon muskets fire and smoke. through the fire and through the smokein the fire and in the smoke for the sea cast him up against a cannon and on the instant he became a cannonierdefarge of the wineshop worked like a manful soldier two fierce hours.  deep ditch

madame his wife. what we can kill as well as the men when the place is taken and to her with a shrill thirsty cry trooping women variously armed but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.  cannon muskets fire and smoke but still the deep ditch the single drawbridge the massive stone walls and the eight great towers. slight displacements of the raging sea made by the falling wounded. flashing weapons blazing torches smoking waggonloads of wet straw hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions shrieks volleys execrations bravery without stint boom smash and rattle and the furious sounding of the living sea but still the deep ditch and the single drawbridge and the massive stone walls and the eight great towers and still defarge of the wineshop at his gun grown doubly hot by the service of four fierce hours.  a white flag from within the fortress and a parleythis dimly perceptible through the raging storm nothing audible in itsuddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher and swept defarge of the wineshop over the lowered drawbridge past the massive stone outer walls in among the eight great towers surrendered  so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the south sea until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the bastille. there against an angle of a wall he made a struggle to look about him. jacques three was nearly at his side madame defarge still heading some of her women was visible in the inner distance and her knife was in her hand. everywhere was tumult exultation deafening and maniacal bewilderment astounding noise yet furious dumbshow.  the prisoners  the records  the secret cells  the instruments of torture  the prisoners  of all these cries and ten thousand incoherences the prisoners was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in as if there were an eternity of people as well as of time and space. when the foremost billows rolled past bearing the prison officers with them and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these mena man with a grey head who had a lighted torch in his handseparated him from the rest and got him between himself and the wall.  show me the north tower said defarge. quick  i will faithfully replied the man if you will come with me. but there is no one there.  what is the meaning of one hundred and five north tower asked defarge. quick  the meaning monsieur  does it mean a captive or a place of captivity or do you mean that i shall strike you dead  kill him croaked jacques three who had come close up.  monsieur it is a cell.  show it me  pass this way then.  jacques three with his usual craving on him and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed held by defarges arm as he held by the turnkeys. their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another even then so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean in its irruption into the fortress and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. all around outside too it beat the walls with a deep hoarse roar from which occasionally some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.  through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone past hideous doors of dark dens and cages down cavernous flights of steps and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick more like dry waterfalls than staircases defarge the turnkey and jacques three linked hand and arm went with all the speed they could make. here and there especially at first the inundation started on them and swept by but when they had done descending and were winding and climbing up a tower they were alone. hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull subdued way as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.  the turnkey stopped at a low door put a key in a clashing lock swung the door slowly open and said as they all bent their heads and passed in  one hundred and five north tower  there was a small heavilygrated unglazed window high in the wall with a stone screen before it so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. there was a small chimney heavily barred across a few feet within. there was a heap of old feathery woodashes on the hearth. there was a stool and table and a straw bed. there were the four blackened walls and a rusted iron ring in one of them.  pass that torch slowly along these walls that i may see them said defarge to the turnkey.  the man obeyed and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.  stoplook here jacques  a. m. croaked jacques three as he read greedily.  alexandre manette said defarge in his ear following the letters with his swart forefinger deeply engrained with gunpowder. and here he wrote a poor physician. and it was he without doubt who scratched a calendar on this stone. what is that in your hand a crowbar give it me  he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. he made a sudden exchange of the two instruments and turning on the wormeaten stool and table beat them to pieces in a few blows.  hold the light higher he said wrathfully to the turnkey. look among those fragments with care jacques. and see here is my knife  throwing it to him rip open that bed and search the straw. hold the light higher you  with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth and peering up the chimney struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar and worked at the iron grating across it. in a few minutes some mortar and dust came dropping down which he averted his face to avoid and in it and in the old woodashes and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself he groped with a cautious touch.  nothing in the wood and nothing in the straw jacques  nothing.  let us collect them together in the middle of the cell. so light them you  the turnkey fired the little pile which blazed high and hot. stooping again to come out at the lowarched door they left it burning and retraced their way to the courtyard seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down until they were in the raging flood once more.  they found it surging and tossing in quest of defarge himself. saint antoine was clamorous to have its wineshop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people. otherwise the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for judgment. otherwise the governor would escape and the peoples blood suddenly of some value after many years of worthlessness be unavenged.  in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration there was but one quite steady figure and that was a womans. see there is my husband she cried pointing him out. see defarge she stood immovable close to the grim old officer and remained immovable close to him remained immovable close to him through the streets as defarge and the rest bore him along remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination and began to be struck at from behind remained immovable close to him when the longgathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy was so close to him when he dropped dead under it that suddenly animated she put her foot upon his neck and with her cruel knifelong readyhewed off his head.  the hour was come when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. saint antoines blood was up and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was downdown on the steps of the hotel de ville where the governors body laydown on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. lower the lamp yonder cried saint antoine after glaring round for a new means of death here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard the swinging sentinel was posted and the sea rushed on.  the sea of black and threatening waters and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes voices of vengeance and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.  but in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life there were two groups of faceseach seven in numberso fixedly contrasting with the rest that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it. seven faces of prisoners suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb were carried high overhead all scared all lost all wondering and amazed as if the last day were come and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits. other seven faces there were carried higher seven dead faces whose drooping eyelids and halfseen eyes awaited the last day. impassive faces yet with a suspendednot an abolishedexpression on them faces rather in a fearful pause as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes and bear witness with the bloodless lips thou didst it  seven prisoners released seven gory heads on pikes the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time long dead of broken heartssuch and suchlike the loudly echoing footsteps of saint antoine escort through the paris streets in midjuly one thousand seven hundred and eightynine. now heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay and keep these feet far out of her life for they are headlong mad and dangerous and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at defarges wineshop door they are not easily purified when once stained red.     chapter xxii. the sea still rises   haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations when madame defarge sat at her counter as usual presiding over the customers. madame defarge wore no rose in her head for the great brotherhood of spies had become even in one short week extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saints mercies. the lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.  madame defarge with her arms folded sat in the morning light and heat contemplating the wineshop and the street. in both there were several knots of loungers squalid and miserable but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. the raggedest nightcap awry on the wretchedest head had this crooked significance in it i know how hard it has grown for me the wearer of this to support life in myself but do you know how easy it has grown for me the wearer of this to destroy life in you every lean bare arm that had been without work before had this work always ready for it now that it could strike. the fingers of the knitting women were vicious with the experience that they could tear. there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.  madame defarge sat observing it with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women. one of her sisterhood knitted beside her. the short rather plump wife of a starved grocer and the mother of two children withal this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance.  hark said the vengeance. listen then who comes  as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine quarter to the wineshop door had been suddenly fired a fastspreading murmur came rushing along.  it is defarge said madame. silence patriots  defarge came in breathless pulled off a red cap he wore and looked around him listen everywhere said madame again. listen to him  defarge stood panting against a background of eager eyes and open mouths formed outside the door all those within the wineshop had sprung to their feet.  say then my husband. what is it  news from the other world  how then cried madame contemptuously. the other world  does everybody here recall old foulon who told the famished people that they might eat grass and who died and went to hell  everybody from all throats.  the news is of him. he is among us  among us from the universal throat again. and dead  not dead he feared us so muchand with reasonthat he caused himself to be represented as dead and had a grand mockfuneral. but they have found him alive hiding in the country and have brought him in. i have seen him but now on his way to the hotel de ville a prisoner. i have said that he had reason to fear us. say all had he reason  wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten if he had never known it yet he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.  a moment of profound silence followed. defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another. the vengeance stooped and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.  patriots said defarge in a determined voice are we ready  instantly madame defarges knife was in her girdle the drum was beating in the streets as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic and the vengeance uttering terrific shrieks and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty furies at once was tearing from house to house rousing the women.  the men were terrible in the bloodyminded anger with which they looked from windows caught up what arms they had and came pouring down into the streets but the women were a sight to chill the boldest. from such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded from their children from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked they ran out with streaming hair urging one another and themselves to madness with the wildest cries and actions. villain foulon taken my sister old foulon taken my mother miscreant foulon taken my daughter then a score of others ran into the midst of these beating their breasts tearing their hair and screaming foulon alive foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass when i had no bread to give him foulon who told my baby it might suck grass when these breasts were dry with want o mother of god this foulon o heaven our suffering hear me my dead baby and my withered father i swear on my knees on these stones to avenge you on foulon husbands and brothers and young men give us the blood of foulon give us the head of foulon give us the heart of foulon give us the body and soul of foulon rend foulon to pieces and dig him into the ground that grass may grow from him with these cries numbers of the women lashed into blind frenzy whirled about striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.  nevertheless not a moment was lost not a moment this foulon was at the hotel de ville and might be loosed. never if saint antoine knew his own sufferings insults and wrongs armed men and women flocked out of the quarter so fast and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in saint antoines bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.  no. they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where this old man ugly and wicked was and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets. the defarges husband and wife the vengeance and jacques three were in the first press and at no great distance from him in the hall.  see cried madame pointing with her knife. see the old villain bound with ropes. that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back. ha ha that was well done. let him eat it now madame put her knife under her arm and clapped her hands as at a play.  the people immediately behind madame defarge explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them and those again explaining to others and those to others the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. similarly during two or three hours of drawl and the winnowing of many bushels of words madame defarges frequent expressions of impatience were taken up with marvellous quickness at a distance the more readily because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows knew madame defarge well and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.  at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection directly down upon the old prisoners head. the favour was too much to bear in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long went to the winds and saint antoine had got him  it was known directly to the furthest confines of the crowd. defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embracemadame defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tiedthe vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall like birds of prey from their high percheswhen the cry seemed to go up all over the city bring him out bring him to the lamp  down and up and head foremost on the steps of the building now on his knees now on his feet now on his back dragged and struck at and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him goas a cat might have done to a mouseand silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. once he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of.  nor was this the end of the days bad work for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when the day closed in that the soninlaw of the despatched another of the peoples enemies and insulters was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong in cavalry alone. saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper seized himwould have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon companyset his head and heart on pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolfprocession through the streets.  not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and breadless. then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip. gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors.  scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sauce to wretched bread. yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them. fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped.  it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear  eh well returned madame. almost.  saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer and the drum was at rest. the drums was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. the vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foulon was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoines bosom.     chapter xxiii. fire rises   there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of them knew what his men would dobeyond this that it would probably not be what he was ordered.  far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation. every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. everything was bowed down dejected oppressed and broken. habitations fences domesticated animals men women children and the soil that bore themall worn out.  monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought things to this. strange that creation designed expressly for monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must be something shortsighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.  but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like it. for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chasenow found in hunting the people now found in hunting the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. no. the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur.  for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the dust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had itin these times as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now a frequent presence. as it advanced the mender of roads would discern without surprise that it was a shaggyhaired man of almost barbarian aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.  such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.  the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill and at the prison on the crag. when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just intelligible  how goes it jacques  all well jacques.  touch then  they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones.  no dinner  nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face.  it is the fashion growled the man. i meet no dinner anywhere.  he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint and steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.  touch then. it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time after observing these operations. they again joined hands.  tonight said the mender of roads.  tonight said the man putting the pipe in his mouth.  where  here.  he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village.  show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill.  see returned the mender of roads with extended finger. you go down here and straight through the street and past the fountain  to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye over the landscape. i go through no streets and past no fountains. well  well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.  good. when do you cease to work  at sunset.  will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without resting. let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child. will you wake me  surely.  the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slipped off his great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. he was fast asleep directly.  as the roadmender plied his dusty labour and the hailclouds rolling away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a red cap now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account. the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen red cap the rough medley dress of homespun stuff and hairy skins of beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender of roads with awe. the traveller had travelled far and his feet were footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes as he himself was into sores. stooping down beside him the roadmender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips. fortified towns with their stockades guardhouses gates trenches and drawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against this figure. and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no obstacle tending to centres all over france.  the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing. then the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village roused him.  good said the sleeper rising on his elbow. two leagues beyond the summit of the hill  about.  about. good  the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there. a curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. monsieur gabelle chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his housetop alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need to ring the tocsin byandbye.  the night deepened. the trees environing the old chateau keeping its solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept. east west north and south through the woods four heavytreading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. four lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all was black again.  but not for long. presently the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous. then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches and windows were. then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter. soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire.  a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. there was spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelles door. help gabelle help every one the tocsin rang impatiently but other help if that were any there was none. the mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved.  the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on the crag. at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire removed from them a group of soldiers. help gentlemenofficers the chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid help help the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting of lips it must burn.  as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the village was illuminating. the mender of roads and the two hundred and fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. the general scarcity of everything occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionarys part the mender of roads once so submissive to authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with and that posthorses would roast.  the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. in the roaring and raging of the conflagration a redhot wind driving straight from the infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away. with the rising and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake and contending with the fire.  the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce figures begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures trudged away east west north and south along the nightenshrouded roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next destination. the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and abolishing the lawful ringer rang for joy.  not only that but the village lightheaded with famine fire and bellringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in those latter daysbecame impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his house summoned him to come forth for personal conference. whereupon monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel with himself. the result of that conference was that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys this time resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet and crush a man or two below.  probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door combined with the joyringing for music not to mention his having an illomened lamp slung across the road before his postinghouse gate which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the rushcandles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.  within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom the rising sun found hanging across oncepeaceful streets where they had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up in their turn. but the fierce figures were steadily wending east west north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned. the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate successfully.     chapter xxiv. drawn to the loadstone rock   in such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years of tempest were consumed. three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.  many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet. for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted in.  monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and this life together. like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after boldly reading the lords prayer backwards for a great number of years and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.  the shining bulls eye of the court was gone or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. it had never been a good eye to see withhad long had the mote in it of lucifers pride sardanapaluss luxury and a moles blindnessbut it had dropped out and was gone. the court from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was all gone together. royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and suspended when the last tidings came over.  the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo was come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.  as was natural the headquarters and great gatheringplace of monseigneur in london was tellsons bank. spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon came quickest. again tellsons was a munificent house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. again those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made provident remittances to tellsons were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. to which it must be added that every newcomer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellsons almost as a matter of course. for such variety of reasons tellsons was at that time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous that tellsons sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran through temple bar to read.  on a steaming misty afternoon mr. lorry sat at his desk and charles darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice. the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now the newsexchange and was filled to overflowing. it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.  but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you  i understand. that i am too old said mr. lorry.  unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling a disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you.  my dear charles said mr. lorry with cheerful confidence you touch some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away. it is safe enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. as to its being a disorganised city if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our house here to our house there who knows the city and the business of old and is in tellsons confidence. as to the uncertain travelling the long journey and the winter weather if i were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellsons after all these years who ought to be  i wish i were going myself said charles darnay somewhat restlessly and like one thinking aloud.  indeed you are a pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimed mr. lorry. you wish you were going yourself and you a frenchman born you are a wise counsellor.  my dear mr. lorry it is because i am a frenchman born that the thought which i did not mean to utter here however has passed through my mind often. one cannot help thinking having had some sympathy for the miserable people and having abandoned something to them he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner that one might be listened to and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. only last night after you had left us when i was talking to lucie  when you were talking to lucie mr. lorry repeated. yes. i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie wishing you were going to france at this time of day  however i am not going said charles darnay with a smile. it is more to the purpose that you say you are.  and i am in plain reality. the truth is my dear charles mr. lorry glanced at the distant house and lowered his voice you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. the lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people if some of our documents were seized or destroyed and they might be at any time you know for who can say that paris is not set afire today or sacked tomorrow now a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay and the burying of them or otherwise getting of them out of harms way is within the power without loss of precious time of scarcely any one but myself if any one. and shall i hang back when tellsons knows this and says thistellsons whose bread i have eaten these sixty yearsbecause i am a little stiff about the joints why i am a boy sir to half a dozen old codgers here  how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit mr. lorry.  tut nonsense sirand my dear charles said mr. lorry glancing at the house again you are to remember that getting things out of paris at this present time no matter what things is next to an impossibility. papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here i speak in strict confidence it is not businesslike to whisper it even to you by the strangest bearers you can imagine every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the barriers. at another time our parcels would come and go as easily as in businesslike old england but now everything is stopped.  and do you really go tonight  i really go tonight for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.  and do you take no one with you  all sorts of people have been proposed to me but i will have nothing to say to any of them. i intend to take jerry. jerry has been my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him. nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bulldog or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.  i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.  i must say again nonsense nonsense when i have executed this little commission i shall perhaps accept tellsons proposal to retire and live at my ease. time enough then to think about growing old.  this dialogue had taken place at mr. lorrys usual desk with monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascalpeople before long. it was too much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee and it was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy to talk of this terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sownas if nothing had ever been done or omitted to be done that had led to itas if observers of the wretched millions in france and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous had not seen it inevitably coming years before and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. such vapouring combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. and it was such vapouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so.  among the talkers was stryver of the kings bench bar far on his way to state promotion and therefore loud on the theme broaching to monseigneur his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth and doing without them and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. him darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection and darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more and remaining to interpose his word when the thing that was to be went on to shape itself out.  the house approached mr. lorry and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the directionthe more quickly because it was his own right name. the address turned into english ran  very pressing. to monsieur heretofore the marquis st. evrmonde of france. confided to the cares of messrs. tellson and co. bankers london england.  on the marriage morning doctor manette had made it his one urgent and express request to charles darnay that the secret of this name should beunless he the doctor dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them. nobody else knew it to be his name his own wife had no suspicion of the fact mr. lorry could have none.  no said mr. lorry in reply to the house i have referred it i think to everybody now here and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.  the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank there was a general set of the current of talkers past mr. lorrys desk. he held the letter out inquiringly and monseigneur looked at it in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee and monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee and this that and the other all had something disparaging to say in french or in english concerning the marquis who was not to be found.  nephew i believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polished marquis who was murdered said one. happy to say i never knew him.  a craven who abandoned his post said anotherthis monseigneur had been got out of paris legs uppermost and half suffocated in a load of haysome years ago.  infected with the new doctrines said a third eyeing the direction through his glass in passing set himself in opposition to the last marquis abandoned the estates when he inherited them and left them to the ruffian herd. they will recompense him now i hope as he deserves.  hey cried the blatant stryver. did he though is that the sort of fellow let us look at his infamous name. dn the fellow  darnay unable to restrain himself any longer touched mr. stryver on the shoulder and said  i know the fellow.  do you by jupiter said stryver. i am sorry for it.  why  why mr. darnay dye hear what he did dont ask why in these times.  but i do ask why  then i tell you again mr. darnay i am sorry for it. i am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. here is a fellow who infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale and you ask me why i am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him well but ill answer you. i am sorry because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. thats why.  mindful of the secret darnay with great difficulty checked himself and said you may not understand the gentleman.  i understand how to put you in a corner mr. darnay said bully stryver and ill do it. if this fellow is a gentleman i dont understand him. you may tell him so with my compliments. you may also tell him from me that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob i wonder he is not at the head of them. but no gentlemen said stryver looking all round and snapping his fingers i know something of human nature and i tell you that youll never find a fellow like this fellow trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protgs. no gentlemen hell always show em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle and sneak away.  with those words and a final snap of his fingers mr. stryver shouldered himself into fleetstreet amidst the general approbation of his hearers. mr. lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk in the general departure from the bank.  will you take charge of the letter said mr. lorry. you know where to deliver it  i do.  will you undertake to explain that we suppose it to have been addressed here on the chance of our knowing where to forward it and that it has been here some time  i will do so. do you start for paris from here  from here at eight.  i will come back to see you off.  very ill at ease with himself and with stryver and most other men darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple opened the letter and read it. these were its contents   prison of the abbaye paris.  june  . monsieur heretofore the marquis.  after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village i have been seized with great violence and indignity and brought a long journey on foot to paris. on the road i have suffered a great deal. nor is that all my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground.  the crime for which i am imprisoned monsieur heretofore the marquis and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal and shall lose my life without your so generous help is they tell me treason against the majesty of the people in that i have acted against them for an emigrant. it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them and not against according to your commands. it is in vain i represent that before the sequestration of emigrant property i had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay that i had collected no rent that i had had recourse to no process. the only response is that i have acted for an emigrant and where is that emigrant  ah most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis where is that emigrant i cry in my sleep where is he i demand of heaven will he not come to deliver me no answer. ah monsieur heretofore the marquis i send my desolate cry across the sea hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris  for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of the honour of your noble name i supplicate you monsieur heretofore the marquis to succour and release me. my fault is that i have been true to you. oh monsieur heretofore the marquis i pray you be you true to me  from this prison here of horror whence i every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction i send you monsieur heretofore the marquis the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.  your afflicted  gabelle.   the latent uneasiness in darnays mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. the peril of an old servant and a good one whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him so reproachfully in the face that as he walked to and fro in the temple considering what to do he almost hid his face from the passersby.  he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house in his resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold he had acted imperfectly. he knew very well that in his love for lucie his renunciation of his social place though by no means new to his own mind had been hurried and incomplete. he knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it and that he had meant to do it and that it had never been done.  the happiness of his own chosen english home the necessity of being always actively employed the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events of the week following made all new again he knew very well that to the force of these circumstances he had yieldednot without disquiet but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. that he had watched the times for a time of action and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by and the nobility were trooping from france by every highway and byway and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction and their very names were blotting out was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in france that might impeach him for it.  but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he had relinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with no favour in it won his own private place there and earned his own bread. monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions to spare the people to give them what little there was to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof for his own safety so that it could not but appear now.  this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make that he would go to paris.  yes. like the mariner in the old story the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it was drawing him to itself and he must go. everything that arose before his mind drifted him on faster and faster more and more steadily to the terrible attraction. his latent uneasiness had been that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they was not there trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. with this uneasiness half stifled and half reproaching him he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong upon that comparison injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur which had stung him bitterly and those of stryver which above all were coarse and galling for old reasons. upon those had followed gabelles letter the appeal of an innocent prisoner in danger of death to his justice honour and good name.  his resolution was made. he must go to paris.  yes. the loadstone rock was drawing him and he must sail on until he struck. he knew of no rock he saw hardly any danger. the intention with which he had done what he had done even although he had left it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert it. then that glorious vision of doing good which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging revolution that was running so fearfully wild.  as he walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered that neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. lucie should be spared the pain of separation and her father always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old should come to the knowledge of the step as a step taken and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. how much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind he did not discuss with himself. but that circumstance too had had its influence in his course.  he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to return to tellsons and take leave of mr. lorry. as soon as he arrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend but he must say nothing of his intention now.  a carriage with posthorses was ready at the bank door and jerry was booted and equipped.  i have delivered that letter said charles darnay to mr. lorry. i would not consent to your being charged with any written answer but perhaps you will take a verbal one  that i will and readily said mr. lorry if it is not dangerous.  not at all. though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye.  what is his name said mr. lorry with his open pocketbook in his hand.  gabelle.  gabelle. and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison  simply that he has received the letter and will come.  any time mentioned  he will start upon his journey tomorrow night.  any person mentioned  no.  he helped mr. lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank into the misty air of fleetstreet. my love to lucie and to little lucie said mr. lorry at parting and take precious care of them till i come back.  charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled as the carriage rolled away.  that nightit was the fourteenth of augusthe sat up late and wrote two fervent letters one was to lucie explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to paris and showing her at length the reasons that he had for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there the other was to the doctor confiding lucie and their dear child to his care and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances. to both he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety immediately after his arrival.  it was a hard day that day of being among them with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. it was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. but an affectionate glance at his wife so happy and busy made him resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid and the day passed quickly. early in the evening he embraced her and her scarcely less dear namesake pretending that he would return byandbye an imaginary engagement took him out and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets with a heavier heart.  the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself now and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. he left his two letters with a trusty porter to be delivered half an hour before midnight and no sooner took horse for dover and began his journey. for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of the honour of your noble name was the poor prisoners cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart as he left all that was dear on earth behind him and floated away for the loadstone rock.   the end of the second book.     book the thirdthe track of a storm     chapter i. in secret   the traveller fared slowly on his way who fared towards paris from england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo. more than enough of bad roads bad equipages and bad horses he would have encountered to delay him though the fallen and unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory but the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. every towngate and village taxinghouse had its band of citizenpatriots with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness who stopped all comers and goers crossquestioned them inspected their papers looked for their names in lists of their own turned them back or sent them on or stopped them and laid them in hold as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or death.  a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished when charles darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at paris. whatever might befall now he must on to his journeys end. not a mean village closed upon him not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and england. the universal watchfulness so encompassed him that if he had been taken in a net or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.  this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in a day by riding after him and taking him back riding before him and stopping him by anticipation riding with him and keeping him in charge. he had been days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in a little town on the high road still a long way from paris.  nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelles letter from his prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far. his difficulty at the guardhouse in this small place had been such that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. and he was therefore as little surprised as a man could be to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning in the middle of the night.  awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on the bed.  emigrant said the functionary i am going to send you on to paris under an escort.  citizen i desire nothing more than to get to paris though i could dispense with the escort.  silence growled a redcap striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his musket. peace aristocrat  it is as the good patriot says observed the timid functionary. you are an aristocrat and must have an escortand must pay for it.  i have no choice said charles darnay.  choice listen to him cried the same scowling redcap. as if it was not a favour to be protected from the lampiron  it is always as the good patriot says observed the functionary. rise and dress yourself emigrant.  darnay complied and was taken back to the guardhouse where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleeping by a watchfire. here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning.  the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades armed with national muskets and sabres who rode one on either side of him.  the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attached to his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist. in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement and out upon the miredeep roads. in this state they traversed without change except of horses and pace all the miredeep leagues that lay between them and the capital.  they travelled in the night halting an hour or two after daybreak and lying by until the twilight fell. the escort were so wretchedly clothed that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying his musket very recklessly charles darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast for he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made.  but when they came to the town of beauvaiswhich they did at eventide when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. an ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard and many voices called out loudly down with the emigrant  he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle and resuming it as his safest place said  emigrant my friends do you not see me here in france of my own will  you are a cursed emigrant cried a farrier making at him in a furious manner through the press hammer in hand and you are a cursed aristocrat  the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the riders bridle at which he was evidently making and soothingly said let him be let him be he will be judged at paris.  judged repeated the farrier swinging his hammer. ay and condemned as a traitor. at this the crowd roared approval.  checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to the yard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on with the line round his wrist darnay said as soon as he could make his voice heard  friends you deceive yourselves or you are deceived. i am not a traitor.  he lies cried the smith. he is a traitor since the decree. his life is forfeit to the people. his cursed life is not his own  at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd which another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. the farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned but no more was done.  what is this decree that the smith spoke of darnay asked the postmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yard.  truly a decree for selling the property of emigrants.  when passed  on the fourteenth.  the day i left england  everybody says it is but one of several and that there will be othersif there are not alreadybanishing all emigrants and condemning all to death who return. that is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.  but there are no such decrees yet  what do i know said the postmaster shrugging his shoulders there may be or there will be. it is all the same. what would you have  they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. after long and lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty or all drawn up together singing a liberty song. happily however there was sleep in beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness jingling through the untimely cold and wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.  daylight at last found them before the wall of paris. the barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.  where are the papers of this prisoner demanded a resolutelooking man in authority who was summoned out by the guard.  naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him and which he had paid for.  where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him whatever are the papers of this prisoner  the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them. casting his eyes over gabelles letter the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise and looked at darnay with a close attention.  he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went into the guardroom meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the gate. looking about him while in this state of suspense charles darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots the latter far outnumbering the former and that while ingress into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the homeliest people was very difficult. a numerous medley of men and women not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue forth but the previous identification was so strict that they filtered through the barrier very slowly. some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered about. the red cap and tricolour cockade were universal both among men and women.  when he had sat in his saddle some halfhour taking note of these things darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority who directed the guard to open the barrier. then he delivered to the escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him to dismount. he did so and the two patriots leading his tired horse turned and rode away without entering the city.  he accompanied his conductor into a guardroom smelling of common wine and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying about. the light in the guardhouse half derived from the waning oillamps of the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondingly uncertain condition. some registers were lying open on a desk and an officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these.  citizen defarge said he to darnays conductor as he took a slip of paper to write on. is this the emigrant evrmonde  this is the man.  your age evrmonde  thirtyseven.  married evrmonde  yes.  where married  in england.  without doubt. where is your wife evrmonde  in england.  without doubt. you are consigned evrmonde to the prison of la force.  just heaven exclaimed darnay. under what law and for what offence  the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.  we have new laws evrmonde and new offences since you were here. he said it with a hard smile and went on writing.  i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily in response to that written appeal of a fellowcountryman which lies before you. i demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. is not that my right  emigrants have no rights evrmonde was the stolid reply. the officer wrote until he had finished read over to himself what he had written sanded it and handed it to defarge with the words in secret.  defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. the prisoner obeyed and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.  is it you said defarge in a low voice as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter of doctor manette once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more  yes replied darnay looking at him with surprise.  my name is defarge and i keep a wineshop in the quarter saint antoine. possibly you have heard of me.  my wife came to your house to reclaim her father yes  the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge to say with sudden impatience in the name of that sharp female newlyborn and called la guillotine why did you come to france  you heard me say why a minute ago. do you not believe it is the truth  a bad truth for you said defarge speaking with knitted brows and looking straight before him.  indeed i am lost here. all here is so unprecedented so changed so sudden and unfair that i am absolutely lost. will you render me a little help  none. defarge spoke always looking straight before him.  will you answer me a single question  perhaps. according to its nature. you can say what it is.  in this prison that i am going to so unjustly shall i have some free communication with the world outside  you will see.  i am not to be buried there prejudged and without any means of presenting my case  you will see. but what then other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons before now.  but never by me citizen defarge.  defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in a steady and set silence. the deeper he sank into this silence the fainter hope there wasor so darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree. he therefore made haste to say  it is of the utmost importance to me you know citizen even better than i of how much importance that i should be able to communicate to mr. lorry of tellsons bank an english gentleman who is now in paris the simple fact without comment that i have been thrown into the prison of la force. will you cause that to be done for me  i will do defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you. my duty is to my country and the people. i am the sworn servant of both against you. i will do nothing for you.  charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride was touched besides. as they walked on in silence he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. the very children scarcely noticed him. a few passers turned their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going to prison was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work. in one narrow dark and dirty street through which they passed an excited orator mounted on a stool was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people of the king and the royal family. the few words that he caught from this mans lips first made it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris. on the road except at beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing. the escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.  that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left england he of course knew now. that perils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster and faster yet he of course knew now. he could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. and yet his misgivings were not so dark as imagined by the light of this later time they would appear. troubled as the future was it was the unknown future and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. the horrible massacre days and nights long which within a few rounds of the clock was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. the sharp female newlyborn and called la guillotine was hardly known to him or to the generality of people by name. the frightful deeds that were to be soon done were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. how could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind  of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruel separation from his wife and child he foreshadowed the likelihood or the certainty but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly. with this on his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he arrived at the prison of la force.  a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom defarge presented the emigrant evrmonde.  what the devil how many more of them exclaimed the man with the bloated face.  defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation and withdrew with his two fellowpatriots.  what the devil i say again exclaimed the gaoler left with his wife. how many more  the gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the question merely replied one must have patience my dear three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added for the love of liberty which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.  the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for  in secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paper. as if i was not already full to bursting  he stuck the paper on a file in an illhumour and charles darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing to and fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seat in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.  come said the chief at length taking up his keys come with me emigrant.  through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behind them until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded with prisoners of both sexes. the women were seated at a long table reading and writing knitting sewing and embroidering the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs or lingering up and down the room.  in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace the newcomer recoiled from this company. but the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride was their all at once rising to receive him with every refinement of manner known to the time and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.  so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen that charles darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead. ghosts all the ghost of beauty the ghost of stateliness the ghost of elegance the ghost of pride the ghost of frivolity the ghost of wit the ghost of youth the ghost of age all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.  it struck him motionless. the gaoler standing at his side and the other gaolers moving about who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were therewith the apparitions of the coquette the young beauty and the mature woman delicately bredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented was heightened to its utmost. surely ghosts all. surely the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades  in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address coming forward i have the honour of giving you welcome to la force and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us. may it soon terminate happily it would be an impertinence elsewhere but it is not so here to ask your name and condition  charles darnay roused himself and gave the required information in words as suitable as he could find.  but i hope said the gentleman following the chief gaoler with his eyes who moved across the room that you are not in secret  i do not understand the meaning of the term but i have heard them say so.  ah what a pity we so much regret it but take courage several members of our society have been in secret at first and it has lasted but a short time. then he added raising his voice i grieve to inform the societyin secret.  there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voicesamong which the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement. he turned at the grated door to render the thanks of his heart it closed under the gaolers hand and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.  the wicket opened on a stone staircase leading upward. when they had ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted them the gaoler opened a low black door and they passed into a solitary cell. it struck cold and damp but was not dark.  yours said the gaoler.  why am i confined alone  how do i know  i can buy pen ink and paper  such are not my orders. you will be visited and can ask then. at present you may buy your food and nothing more.  there were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress. as the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the four walls before going out a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated both in face and person as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. when the gaoler was gone he thought in the same wandering way now am i left as if i were dead. stopping then to look down at the mattress he turned from it with a sick feeling and thought and here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.  five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half. the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell counting its measurement and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. he made shoes he made shoes he made shoes. the prisoner counted the measurement again and paced faster to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. there was one among them the appearance of a lady dressed in black who was leaning in the embrasure of a window and she had a light shining upon her golden hair and she looked like     let us ride on again for gods sake through the illuminated villages with the people all awake     he made shoes he made shoes he made shoes.     five paces by four and a half. with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind the prisoner walked faster and faster obstinately counting and counting and the roar of the city changed to this extentthat it still rolled in like muffled drums but with the wail of voices that he knew in the swell that rose above them.     chapter ii. the grindstone   tellsons bank established in the saint germain quarter of paris was in a wing of a large house approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. the house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles in his own cooks dress and got across the borders. a mere beast of the chase flying from hunters he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.  monseigneur gone and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or death monseigneurs house had been first sequestrated and then confiscated. for all things moved so fast and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation that now upon the third night of the autumn month of september patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of monseigneurs house and had marked it with the tricolour and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.  a place of business in london like tellsons place of business in paris would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette. for what would staid british responsibility and respectability have said to orangetrees in boxes in a bank courtyard and even to a cupid over the counter yet such things were. tellsons had whitewashed the cupid but he was still to be seen on the ceiling in the coolest linen aiming as he very often does at money from morning to night. bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan in lombardstreet london and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy and also of a lookingglass let into the wall and also of clerks not at all old who danced in public on the slightest provocation. yet a french tellsons could get on with these things exceedingly well and as long as the times held together no man had taken fright at them and drawn out his money.  what money would be drawn out of tellsons henceforth and what would lie there lost and forgotten what plate and jewels would tarnish in tellsons hidingplaces while the depositors rusted in prisons and when they should have violently perished how many accounts with tellsons never to be balanced in this world must be carried over into the next no man could have said that night any more than mr. jarvis lorry could though he thought heavily of these questions. he sat by a newlylighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror.  he occupied rooms in the bank in his fidelity to the house of which he had grown to be a part like strong rootivy. it chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building but the truehearted old gentleman never calculated about that. all such circumstances were indifferent to him so that he did his duty. on the opposite side of the courtyard under a colonnade was extensive standingfor carriageswhere indeed some carriages of monseigneur yet stood. against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux and in the light of these standing out in the open air was a large grindstone a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy or other workshop. rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects mr. lorry shivered and retired to his seat by the fire. he had opened not only the glass window but the lattice blind outside it and he had closed both again and he shivered through his frame.  from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring in it weird and unearthly as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to heaven.  thank god said mr. lorry clasping his hands that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town tonight. may he have mercy on all who are in danger  soon afterwards the bell at the great gate sounded and he thought they have come back and sat listening. but there was no loud irruption into the courtyard as he had expected and he heard the gate clash again and all was quiet.  the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the bank which a great change would naturally awaken with such feelings roused. it was well guarded and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it when his door suddenly opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which he fell back in amazement.  lucie and her father lucie with her arms stretched out to him and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.  what is this cried mr. lorry breathless and confused. what is the matter lucie manette what has happened what has brought you here what is it  with the look fixed upon him in her paleness and wildness she panted out in his arms imploringly o my dear friend my husband  your husband lucie  charles.  what of charles  here.  here in paris  has been here some daysthree or fouri dont know how manyi cant collect my thoughts. an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us he was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison.  the old man uttered an irrepressible cry. almost at the same moment the bell of the great gate rang again and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.  what is that noise said the doctor turning towards the window.  dont look cried mr. lorry. dont look out manette for your life dont touch the blind  the doctor turned with his hand upon the fastening of the window and said with a cool bold smile  my dear friend i have a charmed life in this city. i have been a bastille prisoner. there is no patriot in parisin paris in francewho knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille would touch me except to overwhelm me with embraces or carry me in triumph. my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier and gained us news of charles there and brought us here. i knew it would be so i knew i could help charles out of all danger i told lucie so.what is that noise his hand was again upon the window.  dont look cried mr. lorry absolutely desperate. no lucie my dear nor you he got his arm round her and held her. dont be so terrified my love. i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm having happened to charles that i had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. what prison is he in  la force  la force lucie my child if ever you were brave and serviceable in your lifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself now to do exactly as i bid you for more depends upon it than you can think or i can say. there is no help for you in any action on your part tonight you cannot possibly stir out. i say this because what i must bid you to do for charless sake is the hardest thing to do of all. you must instantly be obedient still and quiet. you must let me put you in a room at the back here. you must leave your father and me alone for two minutes and as there are life and death in the world you must not delay.  i will be submissive to you. i see in your face that you know i can do nothing else than this. i know you are true.  the old man kissed her and hurried her into his room and turned the key then came hurrying back to the doctor and opened the window and partly opened the blind and put his hand upon the doctors arm and looked out with him into the courtyard.  looked out upon a throng of men and women not enough in number or near enough to fill the courtyard not more than forty or fifty in all. the people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone it had evidently been set up there for their purpose as in a convenient and retired spot.  but such awful workers and such awful work  the grindstone had a double handle and turning at it madly were two men whose faces as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty and all awry with howling and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. as these ruffians turned and turned their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes now flung backward over their necks some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink and what with dropping blood and what with dropping wine and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood. shouldering one another to get next at the sharpeningstone were men stripped to the waist with the stain all over their limbs and bodies men in all sorts of rags with the stain upon those rags men devilishly set off with spoils of womens lace and silk and ribbon with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. hatchets knives bayonets swords all brought to be sharpened were all red with it. some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them with strips of linen and fragments of dress ligatures various in kind but all deep of the one colour. and as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyeseyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life to petrify with a welldirected gun.  all this was seen in a moment as the vision of a drowning man or of any human creature at any very great pass could see a world if it were there. they drew back from the window and the doctor looked for explanation in his friends ashy face.  they are mr. lorry whispered the words glancing fearfully round at the locked room murdering the prisoners. if you are sure of what you say if you really have the power you think you haveas i believe you havemake yourself known to these devils and get taken to la force. it may be too late i dont know but let it not be a minute later  doctor manette pressed his hand hastened bareheaded out of the room and was in the courtyard when mr. lorry regained the blind.  his streaming white hair his remarkable face and the impetuous confidence of his manner as he put the weapons aside like water carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. for a few moments there was a pause and a hurry and a murmur and the unintelligible sound of his voice and then mr. lorry saw him surrounded by all and in the midst of a line of twenty men long all linked shoulder to shoulder and hand to shoulder hurried out with cries oflive the bastille prisoner help for the bastille prisoners kindred in la force room for the bastille prisoner in front there save the prisoner evrmonde at la force and a thousand answering shouts.  he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart closed the window and the curtain hastened to lucie and told her that her father was assisted by the people and gone in search of her husband. he found her child and miss pross with her but it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.  lucie had by that time fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet clinging to his hand. miss pross had laid the child down on his own bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. o the long long night with the moans of the poor wife and o the long long night with no return of her father and no tidings  twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded and the irruption was repeated and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. what is it cried lucie affrighted. hush the soldiers swords are sharpened there said mr. lorry. the place is national property now and used as a kind of armoury my love.  twice more in all but the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. soon afterwards the day began to dawn and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand and cautiously looked out again. a man so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone and looking about him with a vacant air. shortly this wornout murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of monseigneur and staggering to that gorgeous vehicle climbed in at the door and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.  the great grindstone earth had turned when mr. lorry looked out again and the sun was red on the courtyard. but the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air with a red upon it that the sun had never given and would never take away.     chapter iii. the shadow   one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr. lorry when business hours came round was thisthat he had no right to imperil tellsons by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the bank roof. his own possessions safety life he would have hazarded for lucie and her child without a moments demur but the great trust he held was not his own and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.  at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of finding out the wineshop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwellingplace in the distracted state of the city. but the same consideration that suggested him repudiated him he lived in the most violent quarter and doubtless was influential there and deep in its dangerous workings.  noon coming and the doctor not returning and every minutes delay tending to compromise tellsons mr. lorry advised with lucie. she said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term in that quarter near the bankinghouse. as there was no business objection to this and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles and he were to be released he could not hope to leave the city mr. lorry went out in quest of such a lodging and found a suitable one high up in a removed bystreet where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.  to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child and miss pross giving them what comfort he could and much more than he had himself. he left jerry with them as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head and returned to his own occupations. a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.  it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closed. he was again alone in his room of the previous night considering what to do next when he heard a foot upon the stair. in a few moments a man stood in his presence who with a keenly observant look at him addressed him by his name.  your servant said mr. lorry. do you know me  he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair from fortyfive to fifty years of age. for answer he repeated without any change of emphasis the words  do you know me  i have seen you somewhere.  perhaps at my wineshop  much interested and agitated mr. lorry said you come from doctor manette  yes. i come from doctor manette.  and what says he what does he send me  defarge gave into his anxious hand an open scrap of paper. it bore the words in the doctors writing      charles is safe but i cannot safely leave this place yet.      i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note      from charles to his wife.  let the bearer see his wife.  it was dated from la force within an hour.  will you accompany me said mr. lorry joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud to where his wife resides  yes returned defarge.  scarcely noticing as yet in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way defarge spoke mr. lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard. there they found two women one knitting.  madame defarge surely said mr. lorry who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.  it is she observed her husband.  does madame go with us inquired mr. lorry seeing that she moved as they moved.  yes. that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. it is for their safety.  beginning to be struck by defarges manner mr. lorry looked dubiously at him and led the way. both the women followed the second woman being the vengeance.  they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might ascended the staircase of the new domicile were admitted by jerry and found lucie weeping alone. she was thrown into a transport by the tidings mr. lorry gave her of her husband and clasped the hand that delivered his notelittle thinking what it had been doing near him in the night and might but for a chance have done to him.       dearesttake courage.  i am well and your father has       influence around me.  you cannot answer this.       kiss our child for me.  that was all the writing. it was so much however to her who received it that she turned from defarge to his wife and kissed one of the hands that knitted. it was a passionate loving thankful womanly action but the hand made no responsedropped cold and heavy and took to its knitting again.  there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check. she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom and with her hands yet at her neck looked terrified at madame defarge. madame defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold impassive stare.  my dear said mr. lorry striking in to explain there are frequent risings in the streets and although it is not likely they will ever trouble you madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them. i believe said mr. lorry rather halting in his reassuring words as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more i state the case citizen defarge  defarge looked gloomily at his wife and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.  you had better lucie said mr. lorry doing all he could to propitiate by tone and manner have the dear child here and our good pross. our good pross defarge is an english lady and knows no french.  the lady in question whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner was not to be shaken by distress and danger appeared with folded arms and observed in english to the vengeance whom her eyes first encountered well i am sure boldface i hope you are pretty well she also bestowed a british cough on madame defarge but neither of the two took much heed of her.  is that his child said madame defarge stopping in her work for the first time and pointing her knittingneedle at little lucie as if it were the finger of fate.  yes madame answered mr. lorry this is our poor prisoners darling daughter and only child.  the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her and held her to her breast. the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall threatening and dark on both the mother and the child.  it is enough my husband said madame defarge. i have seen them. we may go.  but the suppressed manner had enough of menace in itnot visible and presented but indistinct and withheldto alarm lucie into saying as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarges dress  you will be good to my poor husband. you will do him no harm. you will help me to see him if you can  your husband is not my business here returned madame defarge looking down at her with perfect composure. it is the daughter of your father who is my business here.  for my sake then be merciful to my husband. for my childs sake she will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. we are more afraid of you than of these others.  madame defarge received it as a compliment and looked at her husband. defarge who had been uneasily biting his thumbnail and looking at her collected his face into a sterner expression.  what is it that your husband says in that little letter asked madame defarge with a lowering smile. influence he says something touching influence  that my father said lucie hurriedly taking the paper from her breast but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it has much influence around him.  surely it will release him said madame defarge. let it do so.  as a wife and mother cried lucie most earnestly i implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess against my innocent husband but to use it in his behalf. o sisterwoman think of me. as a wife and mother  madame defarge looked coldly as ever at the suppliant and said turning to her friend the vengeance  the wives and mothers we have been used to see since we were as little as this child and much less have not been greatly considered we have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them often enough all our lives we have seen our sisterwomen suffer in themselves and in their children poverty nakedness hunger thirst sickness misery oppression and neglect of all kinds  we have seen nothing else returned the vengeance.  we have borne this a long time said madame defarge turning her eyes again upon lucie. judge you is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now  she resumed her knitting and went out. the vengeance followed. defarge went last and closed the door.  courage my dear lucie said mr. lorry as he raised her. courage courage so far all goes well with usmuch much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. cheer up and have a thankful heart.  i am not thankless i hope but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes.  tut tut said mr. lorry what is this despondency in the brave little breast a shadow indeed no substance in it lucie.  but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself for all that and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.     chapter iv. calm in storm   doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her that not until long afterwards when france and she were far apart did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. she only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.  to mr. lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of la force. that in the prison he had found a selfappointed tribunal sitting before which the prisoners were brought singly and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred or to be released or in a few cases to be sent back to their cells. that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille that one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this man was defarge.  that hereupon he had ascertained through the registers on the table that his soninlaw was among the living prisoners and had pleaded hard to the tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake some dirty with murder and some clean some sober and some notfor his life and liberty. that in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system it had been accorded to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court and examined. that he seemed on the point of being at once released when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible to the doctor which led to a few words of secret conference. that the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that the prisoner must remain in custody but should for his sake be held inviolate in safe custody. that immediately on a signal the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again but that he the doctor had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his soninlaw was through no malice or mischance delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings that he had obtained the permission and had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over.  the sights he had seen there with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals shall remain untold. the mad joy over the prisoners who were saved had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. one prisoner there was he said who had been discharged into the street free but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. being besought to go to him and dress the wound the doctor had passed out at the same gate and had found him in the arms of a company of samaritans who were seated on the bodies of their victims. with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare they had helped the healer and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes with his hands and swooned away in the midst of it.  as mr. lorry received these confidences and as he watched the face of his friend now sixtytwo years of age a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.  but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he had never at all known him in his present character. for the first time the doctor felt now that his suffering was strength and power. for the first time he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughters husband and deliver him. it all tended to a good end my friend it was not mere waste and ruin. as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself i will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her by the aid of heaven i will do it thus doctor manette. and when jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes the resolute face the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped like a clock for so many years and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed.  greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with would have yielded before his persevering purpose. while he kept himself in his place as a physician whose business was with all degrees of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good he used his personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons and among them of la force. he could now assure lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone but was mixed with the general body of prisoners he saw her husband weekly and brought sweet messages to her straight from his lips sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her though never by the doctors hand but she was not permitted to write to him for among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.  this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubt still the sagacious mr. lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. nothing unbecoming tinged the pride it was a natural and worthy one but he observed it as a curiosity. the doctor knew that up to that time his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness. now that this was changed and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charless ultimate safety and deliverance he became so far exalted by the change that he took the lead and direction and required them as the weak to trust to him as the strong. the preceding relative positions of himself and lucie were reversed yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. all curious to see thought mr. lorry in his amiably shrewd way but all natural and right so take the lead my dear friend and keep it it couldnt be in better hands.  but though the doctor tried hard and never ceased trying to get charles darnay set at liberty or at least to get him brought to trial the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. the new era began the king was tried doomed and beheaded the republic of liberty equality fraternity or death declared for victory or death against the world in arms the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of notre dame three hundred thousand men summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth rose from all the varying soils of france as if the dragons teeth had been sown broadcast and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain on rock in gravel and alluvial mud under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of the north in fell and forest in the vineyards and the olivegrounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers and in the sand of the seashore. what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year one of libertythe deluge rising from below not falling from above and with the windows of heaven shut not opened  there was no pause no pity no peace no interval of relenting rest no measurement of time. though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young and the evening and morning were the first day other count of time there was none. hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation as it is in the fever of one patient. now breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city the executioner showed the people the head of the kingand now it seemed almost in the same breath the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery to turn it grey.  and yet observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases the time was long while it flamed by so fast. a revolutionary tribunal in the capital and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land a law of the suspected which struck away all security for liberty or life and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence and could obtain no hearing these things became the established order and nature of appointed things and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. above all one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the worldthe figure of the sharp female called la guillotine.  it was the popular theme for jests it was the best cure for headache it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion it was the national razor which shaved close who kissed la guillotine looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. it was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. it superseded the cross. models of it were worn on breasts from which the cross was discarded and it was bowed down to and believed in where the cross was denied.  it sheared off heads so many that it and the ground it most polluted were a rotten red. it was taken to pieces like a toypuzzle for a young devil and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. it hushed the eloquent struck down the powerful abolished the beautiful and good. twentytwo friends of high public mark twentyone living and one dead it had lopped the heads off in one morning in as many minutes. the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it but so armed he was stronger than his namesake and blinder and tore away the gates of gods own temple every day.  among these terrors and the brood belonging to them the doctor walked with a steady head confident in his power cautiously persistent in his end never doubting that he would save lucies husband at last. yet the current of the time swept by so strong and deep and carried the time away so fiercely that charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the doctor was thus steady and confident. so much more wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. still the doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. no man better known than he in paris at that day no man in a stranger situation. silent humane indispensable in hospital and prison using his art equally among assassins and victims he was a man apart. in the exercise of his skill the appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all other men. he was not suspected or brought in question any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before or were a spirit moving among mortals.     chapter v. the woodsawyer   one year and three months. during all that time lucie was never sure from hour to hour but that the guillotine would strike off her husbands head next day. every day through the stony streets the tumbrils now jolted heavily filled with condemned. lovely girls bright women brownhaired blackhaired and grey youths stalwart men and old gentle born and peasant born all red wine for la guillotine all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. liberty equality fraternity or deaththe last much the easiest to bestow o guillotine  if the suddenness of her calamity and the whirling wheels of the time had stunned the doctors daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair it would but have been with her as it was with many. but from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of saint antoine she had been true to her duties. she was truest to them in the season of trial as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.  as soon as they were established in their new residence and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there. everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. little lucie she taught as regularly as if they had all been united in their english home. the slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunitedthe little preparations for his speedy return the setting aside of his chair and his booksthese and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of deathwere almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.  she did not greatly alter in appearance. the plain dark dresses akin to mourning dresses which she and her child wore were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. she lost her colour and the old and intent expression was a constant not an occasional thing otherwise she remained very pretty and comely. sometimes at night on kissing her father she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day and would say that her sole reliance under heaven was on him. he always resolutely answered nothing can happen to him without my knowledge and i know that i can save him lucie.  they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks when her father said to her on coming home one evening  my dear there is an upper window in the prison to which charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. when he can get to itwhich depends on many uncertainties and incidentshe might see you in the street he thinks if you stood in a certain place that i can show you. but you will not be able to see him my poor child and even if you could it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.  o show me the place my father and i will go there every day.  from that time in all weathers she waited there two hours. as the clock struck two she was there and at four she turned resignedly away. when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her they went together at other times she was alone but she never missed a single day.  it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. the hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning was the only house at that end all else was wall. on the third day of her being there he noticed her.  good day citizeness.  good day citizen.  this mode of address was now prescribed by decree. it had been established voluntarily some time ago among the more thorough patriots but was now law for everybody.  walking here again citizeness  you see me citizen  the woodsawyer who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture he had once been a mender of roads cast a glance at the prison pointed at the prison and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars peeped through them jocosely.  but its not my business said he. and went on sawing his wood.  next day he was looking out for her and accosted her the moment she appeared.  what walking here again citizeness  yes citizen.  ah a child too your mother is it not my little citizeness  do i say yes mamma whispered little lucie drawing close to her.  yes dearest.  yes citizen.  ah but its not my business. my work is my business. see my saw i call it my little guillotine. la la la la la la and off his head comes  the billet fell as he spoke and he threw it into a basket.  i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine. see here again loo loo loo loo loo loo and off her head comes now a child. tickle tickle pickle pickle and off its head comes. all the family  lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket but it was impossible to be there while the woodsawyer was at work and not be in his sight. thenceforth to secure his good will she always spoke to him first and often gave him drinkmoney which he readily received.  he was an inquisitive fellow and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates and in lifting her heart up to her husband she would come to herself to find him looking at her with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. but its not my business he would generally say at those times and would briskly fall to his sawing again.  in all weathers in the snow and frost of winter in the bitter winds of spring in the hot sunshine of summer in the rains of autumn and again in the snow and frost of winter lucie passed two hours of every day at this place and every day on leaving it she kissed the prison wall. her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in five or six times it might be twice or thrice running it might be not for a week or a fortnight together. it was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served and on that possibility she would have waited out the day seven days a week.  these occupations brought her round to the december month wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. on a lightlysnowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. it was a day of some wild rejoicing and a festival. she had seen the houses as she came along decorated with little pikes and with little red caps stuck upon them also with tricoloured ribbons also with the standard inscription tricoloured letters were the favourite republic one and indivisible. liberty equality fraternity or death  the miserable shop of the woodsawyer was so small that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. he had got somebody to scrawl it up for him however who had squeezed death in with most inappropriate difficulty. on his housetop he displayed pike and cap as a good citizen must and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his little sainte guillotinefor the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. his shop was shut and he was not there which was a relief to lucie and left her quite alone.  but he was not far off for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along which filled her with fear. a moment afterwards and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall in the midst of whom was the woodsawyer hand in hand with the vengeance. there could not be fewer than five hundred people and they were dancing like five thousand demons. there was no other music than their own singing. they danced to the popular revolution song keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. men and women danced together women danced together men danced together as hazard had brought them together. at first they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags but as they filled the place and stopped to dance about lucie some ghastly apparition of a dancefigure gone raving mad arose among them. they advanced retreated struck at one anothers hands clutched at one anothers heads spun round alone caught one another and spun round in pairs until many of them dropped. while those were down the rest linked hand in hand and all spun round together then the ring broke and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once began again struck clutched and tore and then reversed the spin and all spun round another way. suddenly they stopped again paused struck out the time afresh formed into lines the width of the public way and with their heads low down and their hands high up swooped screaming off. no fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. it was so emphatically a fallen sporta something once innocent delivered over to all devilrya healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood bewildering the senses and steeling the heart. such grace as was visible in it made it the uglier showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. the maidenly bosom bared to this the pretty almostchilds head thus distracted the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt were types of the disjointed time.  this was the carmagnole. as it passed leaving lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the woodsawyers house the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft as if it had never been.  o my father for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand such a cruel bad sight.  i know my dear i know. i have seen it many times. dont be frightened not one of them would harm you.  i am not frightened for myself my father. but when i think of my husband and the mercies of these people  we will set him above their mercies very soon. i left him climbing to the window and i came to tell you. there is no one here to see. you may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.  i do so father and i send him my soul with it  you cannot see him my poor dear  no father said lucie yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand no.  a footstep in the snow. madame defarge. i salute you citizeness  from the doctor. i salute you citizen. this in passing. nothing more. madame defarge gone like a shadow over the white road.  give me your arm my love. pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage for his sake. that was well done they had left the spot it shall not be in vain. charles is summoned for tomorrow.  for tomorrow  there is no time to lose. i am well prepared but there are precautions to be taken that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the tribunal. he has not received the notice yet but i know that he will presently be summoned for tomorrow and removed to the conciergerie i have timely information. you are not afraid  she could scarcely answer i trust in you.  do so implicitly. your suspense is nearly ended my darling he shall be restored to you within a few hours i have encompassed him with every protection. i must see lorry.  he stopped. there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. they both knew too well what it meant. one. two. three. three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.  i must see lorry the doctor repeated turning her another way.  the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust had never left it. he and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national. what he could save for the owners he saved. no better man living to hold fast by what tellsons had in keeping and to hold his peace.  a murky red and yellow sky and a rising mist from the seine denoted the approach of darkness. it was almost dark when they arrived at the bank. the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. above a heap of dust and ashes in the court ran the letters national property. republic one and indivisible. liberty equality fraternity or death  who could that be with mr. lorrythe owner of the ridingcoat upon the chairwho must not be seen from whom newly arrived did he come out agitated and surprised to take his favourite in his arms to whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words when raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued he said removed to the conciergerie and summoned for tomorrow     chapter vi. triumph   the dread tribunal of five judges public prosecutor and determined jury sat every day. their lists went forth every evening and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. the standard gaolerjoke was come out and listen to the evening paper you inside there  charles evrmonde called darnay  so at last began the evening paper at la force.  when a name was called its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. charles evrmonde called darnay had reason to know the usage he had seen hundreds pass away so.  his bloated gaoler who wore spectacles to read with glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place and went through the list making a similar short pause at each name. there were twentythree names but only twenty were responded to for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. the list was read in the vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. every one of those had perished in the massacre every human creature he had since cared for and parted with had died on the scaffold.  there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was soon over. it was the incident of every day and the society of la force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert for that evening. they crowded to the grates and shed tears there but twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled and the time was at best short to the lockup hour when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. the prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling their ways arose out of the condition of the time. similarly though with a subtle difference a species of fervour or intoxication known without doubt to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily and to die by it was not mere boastfulness but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. in seasons of pestilence some of us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea terrible passing inclination to die of it. and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts only needing circumstances to evoke them.  the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark the night in its verminhaunted cells was long and cold. next day fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnays name was called. all the fifteen were condemned and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.  charles evrmonde called darnay was at length arraigned.  his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the headdress otherwise prevailing. looking at the jury and the turbulent audience he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed and that the felons were trying the honest men. the lowest cruelest and worst populace of a city never without its quantity of low cruel and bad were the directing spirits of the scene noisily commenting applauding disapproving anticipating and precipitating the result without a check. of the men the greater part were armed in various ways of the women some wore knives some daggers some ate and drank as they looked on many knitted. among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. she was in a front row by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly remembered as defarge. he noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear and that she seemed to be his wife but what he most noticed in the two figures was that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be they never looked towards him. they seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination and they looked at the jury but at nothing else. under the president sat doctor manette in his usual quiet dress. as well as the prisoner could see he and mr. lorry were the only men there unconnected with the tribunal who wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarse garb of the carmagnole.  charles evrmonde called darnay was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the republic under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death. it was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to france. there he was and there was the decree he had been taken in france and his head was demanded.  take off his head cried the audience. an enemy to the republic  the president rang his bell to silence those cries and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in england  undoubtedly it was.  was he not an emigrant then what did he call himself  not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law.  why not the president desired to know.  because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left his countryhe submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the tribunal was in useto live by his own industry in england rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france.  what proof had he of this  he handed in the names of two witnesses theophile gabelle and alexandre manette.  but he had married in england the president reminded him.  true but not an english woman.  a citizeness of france  yes. by birth.  her name and family  lucie manette only daughter of doctor manette the good physician who sits there.  this answer had a happy effect upon the audience. cries in exaltation of the wellknown good physician rent the hall. so capriciously were the people moved that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.  on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had set his foot according to doctor manettes reiterated instructions. the same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him and had prepared every inch of his road.  the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not sooner  he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had no means of living in france save those he had resigned whereas in england he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature. he had returned when he did on the pressing and written entreaty of a french citizen who represented that his life was endangered by his absence. he had come back to save a citizens life and to bear his testimony at whatever personal hazard to the truth. was that criminal in the eyes of the republic  the populace cried enthusiastically no and the president rang his bell to quiet them. which it did not for they continued to cry no  until they left off of their own will.  the president required the name of that citizen. the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. he also referred with confidence to the citizens letter which had been taken from him at the barrier but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the president.  the doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that it would be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. citizen gabelle was called to confirm it and did so. citizen gabelle hinted with infinite delicacy and politeness that in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbayein fact had rather passed out of the tribunals patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago when he had been summoned before it and had been set at liberty on the jurys declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered as to himself by the surrender of the citizen evrmonde called darnay.  doctor manette was next questioned. his high personal popularity and the clearness of his answers made a great impression but as he proceeded as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment that the accused had remained in england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile that so far from being in favour with the aristocrat government there he had actually been tried for his life by it as the foe of england and friend of the united statesas he brought these circumstances into view with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and the populace became one. at last when he appealed by name to monsieur lorry an english gentleman then and there present who like himself had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his account of it the jury declared that they had heard enough and that they were ready with their votes if the president were content to receive them.  at every vote the jurymen voted aloud and individually the populace set up a shout of applause. all the voices were in the prisoners favour and the president declared him free.  then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy or which they regarded as some setoff against their swollen account of cruel rage. no man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable it is probable to a blending of all the three with the second predominating. no sooner was the acquittal pronounced than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion none the less because he knew very well that the very same people carried by another current would have rushed at him with the very same intensity to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.  his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried rescued him from these caresses for the moment. five were to be tried together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. so quick was the tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost that these five came down to him before he left the place condemned to die within twentyfour hours. the first of them told him so with the customary prison sign of deatha raised fingerand they all added in words long live the republic  the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen their proceedings for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate there was a great crowd about it in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in courtexcept two for which he looked in vain. on his coming out the concourse made at him anew weeping embracing and shouting all by turns and all together until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted seemed to run mad like the people on the shore.  they put him into a great chair they had among them and which they had taken either out of the court itself or one of its rooms or passages. over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. in this car of triumph not even the doctors entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on mens shoulders with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine.  in wild dreamlike procession embracing whom they met and pointing him out they carried him on. reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing republican colour in winding and tramping through them as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. her father had gone on before to prepare her and when her husband stood upon his feet she dropped insensible in his arms.  as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen a few of the people fell to dancing. instantly all the rest fell to dancing and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole. then they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets and along the rivers bank and over the bridge the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.  after grasping the doctors hand as he stood victorious and proud before him after grasping the hand of mr. lorry who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole after kissing little lucie who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who lifted her he took his wife in his arms and carried her up to their rooms.  lucie my own i am safe.  o dearest charles let me thank god for this on my knees as i have prayed to him.  they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. when she was again in his arms he said to her  and now speak to your father dearest. no other man in all this france could have done what he has done for me.  she laid her head upon her fathers breast as she had laid his poor head on her own breast long long ago. he was happy in the return he had made her he was recompensed for his suffering he was proud of his strength. you must not be weak my darling he remonstrated dont tremble so. i have saved him.     chapter vii. a knock at the door   i have saved him. it was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back he was really here. and yet his wife trembled and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.  all the air round was so thick and dark the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. her mind pursued them looking for him among the condemned and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.  her father cheering her showed a compassionate superiority to this womans weakness which was wonderful to see. no garret no shoemaking no one hundred and five north tower now he had accomplished the task he had set himself his promise was redeemed he had saved charles. let them all lean upon him.  their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind not only because that was the safest way of life involving the least offence to the people but because they were not rich and charles throughout his imprisonment had had to pay heavily for his bad food and for his guard and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. partly on this account and partly to avoid a domestic spy they kept no servant the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate rendered them occasional service and jerry almost wholly transferred to them by mr. lorry had become their daily retainer and had his bed there every night.  it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or death that on the door or doorpost of every house the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size at a certain convenient height from the ground. mr. jerry crunchers name therefore duly embellished the doorpost down below and as the afternoon shadows deepened the owner of that name himself appeared from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had employed to add to the list the name of charles evrmonde called darnay.  in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time all the usual harmless ways of life were changed. in the doctors little household as in very many others the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening in small quantities and at various small shops. to avoid attracting notice and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy was the general desire.  for some months past miss pross and mr. cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors the former carrying the money the latter the basket. every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted they fared forth on this duty and made and brought home such purchases as were needful. although miss pross through her long association with a french family might have known as much of their language as of her own if she had had a mind she had no mind in that direction consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as she was pleased to call it than mr. cruncher did. so her manner of marketing was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article and if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted to look round for that thing lay hold of it and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. she always made a bargain for it by holding up as a statement of its just price one finger less than the merchant held up whatever his number might be.  now mr. cruncher said miss pross whose eyes were red with felicity if you are ready i am.  jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss prosss service. he had worn all his rust off long ago but nothing would file his spiky head down.  theres all manner of things wanted said miss pross and we shall have a precious time of it. we want wine among the rest. nice toasts these redheads will be drinking wherever we buy it.  it will be much the same to your knowledge miss i should think  retorted jerry whether they drink your health or the old uns.  whos he said miss pross.  mr. cruncher with some diffidence explained himself as meaning old nicks.  ha said miss pross it doesnt need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. they have but one and its midnight murder and mischief.  hush dear pray pray be cautious cried lucie.  yes yes yes ill be cautious said miss pross but i may say among ourselves that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round going on in the streets. now ladybird never you stir from that fire till i come back take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dont move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till you see me again may i ask a question doctor manette before i go  i think you may take that liberty the doctor answered smiling.  for gracious sake dont talk about liberty we have quite enough of that said miss pross.  hush dear again lucie remonstrated.  well my sweet said miss pross nodding her head emphatically the short and the long of it is that i am a subject of his most gracious majesty king george the third miss pross curtseyed at the name and as such my maxim is confound their politics frustrate their knavish tricks on him our hopes we fix god save the king  mr. cruncher in an access of loyalty growlingly repeated the words after miss pross like somebody at church.  i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you though i wish you had never taken that cold in your voice said miss pross approvingly. but the question doctor manette. is thereit was the good creatures way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all and to come at it in this chance manneris there any prospect yet of our getting out of this place  i fear not yet. it would be dangerous for charles yet.  heighhohum said miss pross cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darlings golden hair in the light of the fire then we must have patience and wait thats all. we must hold up our heads and fight low as my brother solomon used to say. now mr. cruncherdont you move ladybird  they went out leaving lucie and her husband her father and the child by a bright fire. mr. lorry was expected back presently from the banking house. miss pross had lighted the lamp but had put it aside in a corner that they might enjoy the firelight undisturbed. little lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm and he in a tone not rising much above a whisper began to tell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prisonwall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy a service. all was subdued and quiet and lucie was more at ease than she had been.  what is that she cried all at once.  my dear said her father stopping in his story and laying his hand on hers command yourself. what a disordered state you are in the least thingnothingstartles you you your fathers daughter  i thought my father said lucie excusing herself with a pale face and in a faltering voice that i heard strange feet upon the stairs.  my love the staircase is as still as death.  as he said the word a blow was struck upon the door.  oh father father. what can this be hide charles. save him  my child said the doctor rising and laying his hand upon her shoulder i have saved him. what weakness is this my dear let me go to the door.  he took the lamp in his hand crossed the two intervening outer rooms and opened it. a rude clattering of feet over the floor and four rough men in red caps armed with sabres and pistols entered the room.  the citizen evrmonde called darnay said the first.  who seeks him answered darnay.  i seek him. we seek him. i know you evrmonde i saw you before the tribunal today. you are again the prisoner of the republic.  the four surrounded him where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.  tell me how and why am i again a prisoner  it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie and will know tomorrow. you are summoned for tomorrow.  doctor manette whom this visitation had so turned into stone that he stood with the lamp in his hand as if he were a statue made to hold it moved after these words were spoken put the lamp down and confronting the speaker and taking him not ungently by the loose front of his red woollen shirt said  you know him you have said. do you know me  yes i know you citizen doctor.  we all know you citizen doctor said the other three.  he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower voice after a pause  will you answer his question to me then how does this happen  citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine. this citizen pointing out the second who had entered is from saint antoine.  the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added  he is accused by saint antoine.  of what asked the doctor.  citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no more. if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. the republic goes before all. the people is supreme. evrmonde we are pressed.  one word the doctor entreated. will you tell me who denounced him  it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of saint antoine here.  the doctor turned his eyes upon that man. who moved uneasily on his feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said  well truly it is against rule. but he is denouncedand gravelyby the citizen and citizeness defarge. and by one other.  what other  do you ask citizen doctor  yes.  then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be answered tomorrow. now i am dumb     chapter viii. a hand at cards   happily unconscious of the new calamity at home miss pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pontneuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make. mr. cruncher with the basket walked at her side. they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. it was a raw evening and the misty river blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked making guns for the army of the republic. woe to the man who played tricks with that army or got undeserved promotion in it better for him that his beard had never grown for the national razor shaved him close.  having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of oil for the lamp miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted. after peeping into several wineshops she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the national palace once and twice the tuileries where the aspect of things rather took her fancy. it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed and though red with patriotic caps was not so red as the rest. sounding mr. cruncher and finding him of her opinion miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity attended by her cavalier.  slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one barebreasted barearmed sootbegrimed workman reading a journal aloud and of the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid aside to be resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep who in the popular highshouldered shaggy black spencer looked in that attitude like slumbering bears or dogs the two outlandish customers approached the counter and showed what they wanted.  as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a corner and rose to depart. in going he had to face miss pross. no sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered a scream and clapped her hands.  in a moment the whole company were on their feet. that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. everybody looked to see somebody fall but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican the woman evidently english.  what was said in this disappointing anticlimax by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something very voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss pross and her protector though they had been all ears. but they had no ears for anything in their surprise. for it must be recorded that not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation but mr. cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate and individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder.  what is the matter said the man who had caused miss pross to scream speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in english.  oh solomon dear solomon cried miss pross clapping her hands again. after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time do i find you here  dont call me solomon. do you want to be the death of me asked the man in a furtive frightened way.  brother brother cried miss pross bursting into tears. have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question  then hold your meddlesome tongue said solomon and come out if you want to speak to me. pay for your wine and come out. whos this man  miss pross shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother said through her tears mr. cruncher.  let him come out too said solomon. does he think me a ghost  apparently mr. cruncher did to judge from his looks. he said not a word however and miss pross exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. as she did so solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french language which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.  now said solomon stopping at the dark street corner what do you want  how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from cried miss pross to give me such a greeting and show me no affection.  there. confound it there said solomon making a dab at miss prosss lips with his own. now are you content  miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence.  if you expect me to be surprised said her brother solomon i am not surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are here. if you really dont want to endanger my existencewhich i half believe you dogo your ways as soon as possible and let me go mine. i am busy. i am an official.  my english brother solomon mourned miss pross casting up her tearfraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country an official among foreigners and such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his  i said so cried her brother interrupting. i knew it. you want to be the death of me. i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister. just as i am getting on  the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried miss pross. far rather would i never see you again dear solomon though i have ever loved you truly and ever shall. say but one affectionate word to me and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i will detain you no longer.  good miss pross as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. as if mr. lorry had not known it for a fact years ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother had spent her money and left her  he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case all the world over when mr. cruncher touching him on the shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question  i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is john solomon or solomon john  the official turned towards him with sudden distrust. he had not previously uttered a word.  come said mr. cruncher. speak out you know. which by the way was more than he could do himself. john solomon or solomon john she calls you solomon and she must know being your sister. and i know youre john you know. which of the two goes first and regarding that name of pross likewise. that warnt your name over the water.  what do you mean  well i dont know all i mean for i cant call to mind what your name was over the water.  no  no. but ill swear it was a name of two syllables.  indeed  yes. tother ones was one syllable. i know you. you was a spywitness at the bailey. what in the name of the father of lies own father to yourself was you called at that time  barsad said another voice striking in.  thats the name for a thousand pound cried jerry.  the speaker who struck in was sydney carton. he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his ridingcoat and he stood at mr. crunchers elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself.  dont be alarmed my dear miss pross. i arrived at mr. lorrys to his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present myself here to beg a little talk with your brother. i wish you had a better employed brother than mr. barsad. i wish for your sake mr. barsad was not a sheep of the prisons.  sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolers. the spy who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared  ill tell you said sydney. i lighted on you mr. barsad coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls an hour or more ago. you have a face to be remembered and i remember faces well. made curious by seeing you in that connection and having a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your direction. i walked into the wineshop here close after you and sat near you. i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the nature of your calling. and gradually what i had done at random seemed to shape itself into a purpose mr. barsad.  what purpose the spy asked.  it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the street. could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your companyat the office of tellsons bank for instance  under a threat  oh did i say that  then why should i go there  really mr. barsad i cant say if you cant.  do you mean that you wont say sir the spy irresolutely asked.  you apprehend me very clearly mr. barsad. i wont.  cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret mind and with such a man as he had to do with. his practised eye saw it and made the most of it.  now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his sister if any trouble comes of this its your doing.  come come mr. barsad exclaimed sydney. dont be ungrateful. but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. do you go with me to the bank  ill hear what you have got to say. yes ill go with you.  i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. let me take your arm miss pross. this is not a good city at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as your escort knows mr. barsad i will invite him to mr. lorrys with us. are we ready come then  miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and looked up in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man. she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection and with sydneys friendly reassurances adequately to heed what she observed.  they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way to mr. lorrys which was within a few minutes walk. john barsad or solomon pross walked at his side.  mr. lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fireperhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellsons who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a good many years ago. he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger.  miss prosss brother sir said sydney. mr. barsad.  barsad repeated the old gentleman barsad i have an association with the nameand with the face.  i told you you had a remarkable face mr. barsad observed carton coolly. pray sit down.  as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that mr. lorry wanted by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial. mr. lorry immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.  mr. barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of said sydney and has acknowledged the relationship. i pass to worse news. darnay has been arrested again.  struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you tell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am about to return to him  arrested for all that. when was it done mr. barsad  just now if at all.  mr. barsad is the best authority possible sir said sydney and i have it from mr. barsads communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place. he left the messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter. there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.  mr. lorrys business eye read in the speakers face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. confused but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was silently attentive.  now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influence of doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrowyou said he would be before the tribunal again tomorrow mr. barsad  yes i believe so.  in as good stead tomorrow as today. but it may not be so. i own to you i am shaken mr. lorry by doctor manettes not having had the power to prevent this arrest.  he may not have known of it beforehand said mr. lorry.  but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how identified he is with his soninlaw.  thats true mr. lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand at his chin and his troubled eyes on carton.  in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. let the doctor play the winning game i will play the losing one. no mans life here is worth purchase. any one carried home by the people today may be condemned tomorrow. now the stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend in the conciergerie. and the friend i purpose to myself to win is mr. barsad.  you need have good cards sir said the spy.  ill run them over. ill see what i holdmr. lorry you know what a brute i am i wish youd give me a little brandy.  it was put before him and he drank off a glassfuldrank off another glassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away.  mr. barsad he went on in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary of republican committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret informer so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman represents himself to his employers under a false name. thats a very good card. mr. barsad now in the employ of the republican french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government the enemy of france and freedom. thats an excellent card. inference clear as day in this region of suspicion that mr. barsad still in the pay of the aristocratic english government is the spy of pitt the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. thats a card not to be beaten. have you followed my hand mr. barsad  not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily.  i play my ace denunciation of mr. barsad to the nearest section committee. look over your hand mr. barsad and see what you have. dont hurry.  he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy and drank it off. he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. seeing it he poured out and drank another glassful.  look over your hand carefully mr. barsad. take time.  it was a poorer hand than he suspected. mr. barsad saw losing cards in it that sydney carton knew nothing of. thrown out of his honourable employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he was not wanted there our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted service in france first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarges wineshop had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning doctor manettes imprisonment release and history as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the defarges and tried them on madame defarge and had broken down with them signally. he always remembered with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. he knew as every one employed as he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror a word might bring it down upon him. once denounced and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash his last chance of life. besides that all secret men are men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.  you scarcely seem to like your hand said sydney with the greatest composure. do you play  i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to mr. lorry i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken. i admit that i am a spy and that it is considered a discreditable stationthough it must be filled by somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one  i play my ace mr. barsad said carton taking the answer on himself and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes.  i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to hook mr. lorry into the discussion that your respect for my sister  i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother said sydney carton.  you think not sir  i have thoroughly made up my mind about it.  the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour received such a check from the inscrutability of cartonwho was a mystery to wiser and honester men than hethat it faltered here and failed him. while he was at a loss carton said resuming his former air of contemplating cards  and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i have another good card here not yet enumerated. that friend and fellowsheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons who was he  french. you dont know him said the spy quickly.  french eh repeated carton musing and not appearing to notice him at all though he echoed his word. well he may be.  is i assure you said the spy though its not important.  though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanical waythough its not importantno its not important. no. yet i know the face.  i think not. i am sure not. it cant be said the spy.  itcantbe muttered sydney carton retrospectively and idling his glass which fortunately was a small one again. cantbe. spoke good french. yet like a foreigner i thought  provincial said the spy.  no. foreign cried carton striking his open hand on the table as a light broke clearly on his mind. cly disguised but the same man. we had that man before us at the old bailey.  now there you are hasty sir said barsad with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really give me an advantage over you. cly who i will unreservedly admit at this distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead several years. i attended him in his last illness. he was buried in london at the church of saint pancrasinthefields. his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but i helped to lay him in his coffin.  here mr. lorry became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. tracing it to its source he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on mr. crunchers head.  let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair. to show you how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is i will lay before you a certificate of clys burial which i happened to have carried in my pocketbook with a hurried hand he produced and opened it ever since. there it is. oh look at it look at it you may take it in your hand its no forgery.  here mr. lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and mr. cruncher rose and stepped forward. his hair could not have been more violently on end if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built.  unseen by the spy mr. cruncher stood at his side and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.  that there roger cly master said mr. cruncher with a taciturn and ironbound visage. so you put him in his coffin  i did.  who took him out of it  barsad leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean  i mean said mr. cruncher that he warnt never in it. no not he ill have my head took off if he was ever in it.  the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at jerry.  i tell you said jerry that you buried pavingstones and earth in that there coffin. dont go and tell me that you buried cly. it was a take in. me and two more knows it.  how do you know it  whats that to you ecod growled mr. cruncher its you i have got a old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.  sydney carton who with mr. lorry had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business here requested mr. cruncher to moderate and explain himself.  at another time sir he returned evasively the present time is illconwenient for explainin. what i stand to is that he knows well wot that there cly was never in that there coffin. let him say he was in so much as a word of one syllable and ill either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea mr. cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer or ill out and announce him.  humph i see one thing said carton. i hold another card mr. barsad. impossible here in raging paris with suspicion filling the air for you to outlive denunciation when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself who moreover has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again a plot in the prisons of the foreigner against the republic. a strong carda certain guillotine card do you play  no returned the spy. i throw up. i confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob that i only got away from england at the risk of being ducked to death and that cly was so ferreted up and down that he never would have got away at all but for that sham. though how this man knows it was a sham is a wonder of wonders to me.  never you trouble your head about this man retorted the contentious mr. cruncher youll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. and look here once moremr. cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberalityid catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.  the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton and said with more decision it has come to a point. i go on duty soon and cant overstay my time. you told me you had a proposal what is it now it is of no use asking too much of me. ask me to do anything in my office putting my head in great extra danger and i had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. in short i should make that choice. you talk of desperation. we are all desperate here. remember i may denounce you if i think proper and i can swear my way through stone walls and so can others. now what do you want with me  not very much. you are a turnkey at the conciergerie  i tell you once for all there is no such thing as an escape possible  said the spy firmly.  why need you tell me what i have not asked you are a turnkey at the conciergerie  i am sometimes.  you can be when you choose  i can pass in and out when i choose.  sydney carton filled another glass with brandy poured it slowly out upon the hearth and watched it as it dropped. it being all spent he said rising  so far we have spoken before these two because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. come into the dark room here and let us have one final word alone.     chapter ix. the game made   while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room speaking so low that not a sound was heard mr. lorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. that honest tradesmans manner of receiving the look did not inspire confidence he changed the leg on which he rested as often as if he had fifty of those limbs and were trying them all he examined his fingernails with a very questionable closeness of attention and whenever mr. lorrys eye caught his he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it which is seldom if ever known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.  jerry said mr. lorry. come here.  mr. cruncher came forward sideways with one of his shoulders in advance of him.  what have you been besides a messenger  after some cogitation accompanied with an intent look at his patron mr. cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying agicultooral character.  my mind misgives me much said mr. lorry angrily shaking a forefinger at him that you have used the respectable and great house of tellsons as a blind and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description. if you have dont expect me to befriend you when you get back to england. if you have dont expect me to keep your secret. tellsons shall not be imposed upon.  i hope sir pleaded the abashed mr. cruncher that a gentleman like yourself wot ive had the honour of odd jobbing till im grey at it would think twice about harming of me even if it wos soi dont say it is but even if it wos. and which it is to be took into account that if it wos it wouldnt even then be all o one side. thered be two sides to it. there might be medical doctors at the present hour a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman dont pick up his fardensfardens no nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens no nor yet his quartera banking away like smoke at tellsons and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly a going in and going out to their own carriagesah equally like smoke if not more so. well that ud be imposing too on tellsons. for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. and heres mrs. cruncher or leastways wos in the old england times and would be tomorrow if cause given a floppin again the business to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating whereas them medical doctors wives dont flopcatch em at it or if they flop their floppings goes in favour of more patients and how can you rightly have one without tother then wot with undertakers and wot with parish clerks and wot with sextons and wot with private watchmen all awaricious and all in it a man wouldnt get much by it even if it wos so. and wot little a man did get would never prosper with him mr. lorry. hed never have no good of it hed want all along to be out of the line if he could see his way out being once ineven if it wos so.  ugh cried mr. lorry rather relenting nevertheless i am shocked at the sight of you.  now what i would humbly offer to you sir pursued mr. cruncher even if it wos so which i dont say it is  dont prevaricate said mr. lorry.  no i will not sir returned mr. crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practicewhich i dont say it iswot i would humbly offer to you sir would be this. upon that there stool at that there bar sets that there boy of mine brought up and growed up to be a man wot will errand you message you generallightjob you till your heels is where your head is if such should be your wishes. if it wos so which i still dont say it is for i will not prewaricate to you sir let that there boy keep his fathers place and take care of his mother dont blow upon that boys fatherdo not do it sirand let that father go into the line of the reglar diggin and make amends for what he would have undugif it wos soby diggin of em in with a will and with conwictions respectin the futur keepin of em safe. that mr. lorry said mr. cruncher wiping his forehead with his arm as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse is wot i would respectfully offer to you sir. a man dont see all this here a goin on dreadful round him in the way of subjects without heads dear me plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that without havin his serious thoughts of things. and these here would be mine if it wos so entreatin of you fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now i up and said in the good cause when i might have kep it back.  that at least is true said mr. lorry. say no more now. it may be that i shall yet stand your friend if you deserve it and repent in actionnot in words. i want no more words.  mr. cruncher knuckled his forehead as sydney carton and the spy returned from the dark room. adieu mr. barsad said the former our arrangement thus made you have nothing to fear from me.  he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against mr. lorry. when they were alone mr. lorry asked him what he had done  not much. if it should go ill with the prisoner i have ensured access to him once.  mr. lorrys countenance fell.  it is all i could do said carton. to propose too much would be to put this mans head under the axe and as he himself said nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. it was obviously the weakness of the position. there is no help for it.  but access to him said mr. lorry if it should go ill before the tribunal will not save him.  i never said it would.  mr. lorrys eyes gradually sought the fire his sympathy with his darling and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest gradually weakened them he was an old man now overborne with anxiety of late and his tears fell.  you are a good man and a true friend said carton in an altered voice. forgive me if i notice that you are affected. i could not see my father weep and sit by careless. and i could not respect your sorrow more if you were my father. you are free from that misfortune however.  though he said the last words with a slip into his usual manner there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch that mr. lorry who had never seen the better side of him was wholly unprepared for. he gave him his hand and carton gently pressed it.  to return to poor darnay said carton. dont tell her of this interview or this arrangement. it would not enable her to go to see him. she might think it was contrived in case of the worse to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.  mr. lorry had not thought of that and he looked quickly at carton to see if it were in his mind. it seemed to be he returned the look and evidently understood it.  she might think a thousand things carton said and any of them would only add to her trouble. dont speak of me to her. as i said to you when i first came i had better not see her. i can put my hand out to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do without that. you are going to her i hope she must be very desolate tonight.  i am going now directly.  i am glad of that. she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you. how does she look  anxious and unhappy but very beautiful.  ah  it was a long grieving sound like a sighalmost like a sob. it attracted mr. lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to the fire. a light or a shade the old gentleman could not have said which passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hillside on a wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs which was tumbling forward. he wore the white ridingcoat and topboots then in vogue and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale with his long brown hair all untrimmed hanging loose about him. his indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr. lorry his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log when it had broken under the weight of his foot.  i forgot it he said.  mr. lorrys eyes were again attracted to his face. taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly reminded of that expression.  and your duties here have drawn to an end sir said carton turning to him.  yes. as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so unexpectedly i have at length done all that i can do here. i hoped to have left them in perfect safety and then to have quitted paris. i have my leave to pass. i was ready to go.  they were both silent.  yours is a long life to look back upon sir said carton wistfully.  i am in my seventyeighth year.  you have been useful all your life steadily and constantly occupied trusted respected and looked up to  i have been a man of business ever since i have been a man. indeed i may say that i was a man of business when a boy.  see what a place you fill at seventyeight. how many people will miss you when you leave it empty  a solitary old bachelor answered mr. lorry shaking his head. there is nobody to weep for me.  how can you say that wouldnt she weep for you wouldnt her child  yes yes thank god. i didnt quite mean what i said.  it is a thing to thank god for is it not  surely surely.  if you could say with truth to your own solitary heart tonight i have secured to myself the love and attachment the gratitude or respect of no human creature i have won myself a tender place in no regard i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by your seventyeight years would be seventyeight heavy curses would they not  you say truly mr. carton i think they would be.  sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire and after a silence of a few moments said  i should like to ask youdoes your childhood seem far off do the days when you sat at your mothers knee seem days of very long ago  responding to his softened manner mr. lorry answered  twenty years back yes at this time of my life no. for as i draw closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and nearer to the beginning. it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. my heart is touched now by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep of my pretty young mother and i so old and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not so real with me and my faults were not confirmed in me.  i understand the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright flush. and you are the better for it  i hope so.  carton terminated the conversation here by rising to help him on with his outer coat but you said mr. lorry reverting to the theme you are young.  yes said carton. i am not old but my young way was never the way to age. enough of me.  and of me i am sure said mr. lorry. are you going out  ill walk with you to her gate. you know my vagabond and restless habits. if i should prowl about the streets a long time dont be uneasy i shall reappear in the morning. you go to the court tomorrow  yes unhappily.  i shall be there but only as one of the crowd. my spy will find a place for me. take my arm sir.  mr. lorry did so and they went downstairs and out in the streets. a few minutes brought them to mr. lorrys destination. carton left him there but lingered at a little distance and turned back to the gate again when it was shut and touched it. he had heard of her going to the prison every day. she came out here he said looking about him turned this way must have trod on these stones often. let me follow in her steps.  it was ten oclock at night when he stood before the prison of la force where she had stood hundreds of times. a little woodsawyer having closed his shop was smoking his pipe at his shopdoor.  good night citizen said sydney carton pausing in going by for the man eyed him inquisitively.  good night citizen.  how goes the republic  you mean the guillotine. not ill. sixtythree today. we shall mount to a hundred soon. samson and his men complain sometimes of being exhausted. ha ha ha he is so droll that samson. such a barber  do you often go to see him  shave always. every day. what a barber you have seen him at work  never.  go and see him when he has a good batch. figure this to yourself citizen he shaved the sixtythree today in less than two pipes less than two pipes. word of honour  as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to explain how he timed the executioner carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him that he turned away.  but you are not english said the woodsawyer though you wear english dress  yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder.  you speak like a frenchman.  i am an old student here.  aha a perfect frenchman good night englishman.  good night citizen.  but go and see that droll dog the little man persisted calling after him. and take a pipe with you  sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper. then traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier than usual for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terrorhe stopped at a chemists shop which the owner was closing with his own hands. a small dim crooked shop kept in a tortuous uphill thoroughfare by a small dim crooked man.  giving this citizen too good night as he confronted him at his counter he laid the scrap of paper before him. whew the chemist whistled softly as he read it. hi hi hi  sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said  for you citizen  for me.  you will be careful to keep them separate citizen you know the consequences of mixing them  perfectly.  certain small packets were made and given to him. he put them one by one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money for them and deliberately left the shop. there is nothing more to do said he glancing upward at the moon until tomorrow. i cant sleep.  it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fastsailing clouds nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance. it was the settled manner of a tired man who had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.  long ago when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise he had followed his father to the grave. his mother had died years before. these solemn words which had been read at his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.  in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day put to death and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons and still of tomorrows and tomorrows the chain of association that brought the words home like a rusty old ships anchor from the deep might have been easily found. he did not seek it but repeated them and went on.  with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them in the towers of the churches where no prayers were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors plunderers and profligates in the distant burialplaces reserved as they wrote upon the gates for eternal sleep in the abounding gaols and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the guillotine with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury sydney carton crossed the seine again for the lighter streets.  few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps and put on heavy shoes and trudged. but the theatres were all well filled and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed and went chatting home. at one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with a mother looking for a way across the street through the mud. he carried the child over and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.  now that the streets were quiet and the night wore on the words were in the echoes of his feet and were in the air. perfectly calm and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked but he heard them always.  the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the riverwalls of the island of paris where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead face out of the sky. then the night with the moon and the stars turned pale and died and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to deaths dominion.  but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that burden of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun while the river sparkled under it.  the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like a congenial friend in the morning stillness. he walked by the stream far from the houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. when he awoke and was afoot again he lingered there yet a little longer watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless until the stream absorbed it and carried it on to the sea.like me.  a tradingboat with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf then glided into his view floated by him and died away. as its silent track in the water disappeared the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors ended in the words i am the resurrection and the life.  mr. lorry was already out when he got back and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. sydney carton drank nothing but a little coffee ate some bread and having washed and changed to refresh himself went out to the place of trial.  the court was all astir and abuzz when the black sheepwhom many fell away from in dreadpressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd. mr. lorry was there and doctor manette was there. she was there sitting beside her father.  when her husband was brought in she turned a look upon him so sustaining so encouraging so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness yet so courageous for his sake that it called the healthy blood into his face brightened his glance and animated his heart. if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look on sydney carton it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.  before that unjust tribunal there was little or no order of procedure ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. there could have been no such revolution if all laws forms and ceremonies had not first been so monstrously abused that the suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.  every eye was turned to the jury. the same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before and tomorrow and the day after. eager and prominent among them one man with a craving face and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. a lifethirsting canniballooking bloodyminded juryman the jacques three of st. antoine. the whole jury as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.  every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. no favourable leaning in that quarter today. a fell uncompromising murderous businessmeaning there. every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd and gleamed at it approvingly and heads nodded at one another before bending forward with a strained attention.  charles evrmonde called darnay. released yesterday. reaccused and retaken yesterday. indictment delivered to him last night. suspected and denounced enemy of the republic aristocrat one of a family of tyrants one of a race proscribed for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. charles evrmonde called darnay in right of such proscription absolutely dead in law.  to this effect in as few or fewer words the public prosecutor.  the president asked was the accused openly denounced or secretly  openly president.  by whom  three voices. ernest defarge winevendor of st. antoine.  good.  thrse defarge his wife.  good.  alexandre manette physician.  a great uproar took place in the court and in the midst of it doctor manette was seen pale and trembling standing where he had been seated.  president i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud. you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. my daughter and those dear to her are far dearer to me than my life. who and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband of my child  citizen manette be tranquil. to fail in submission to the authority of the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law. as to what is dearer to you than life nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the republic.  loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. the president rang his bell and with warmth resumed.  if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. listen to what is to follow. in the meanwhile be silent  frantic acclamations were again raised. doctor manette sat down with his eyes looking around and his lips trembling his daughter drew closer to him. the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together and restored the usual hand to his mouth.  defarge was produced when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment and of his having been a mere boy in the doctors service and of the release and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. this short examination followed for the court was quick with its work.  you did good service at the taking of the bastille citizen  i believe so.  here an excited woman screeched from the crowd you were one of the best patriots there. why not say so you were a cannonier that day there and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. patriots i speak the truth  it was the vengeance who amidst the warm commendations of the audience thus assisted the proceedings. the president rang his bell but the vengeance warming with encouragement shrieked i defy that bell  wherein she was likewise much commended.  inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille citizen.  i knew said defarge looking down at his wife who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised looking steadily up at him i knew that this prisoner of whom i speak had been confined in a cell known as one hundred and five north tower. i knew it from himself. he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five north tower when he made shoes under my care. as i serve my gun that day i resolve when the place shall fall to examine that cell. it falls. i mount to the cell with a fellowcitizen who is one of the jury directed by a gaoler. i examine it very closely. in a hole in the chimney where a stone has been worked out and replaced i find a written paper. this is that written paper. i have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of doctor manette. this is the writing of doctor manette. i confide this paper in the writing of doctor manette to the hands of the president.  let it be read.  in a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner defarge never taking his from his feasting wife and all the other eyes there intent upon the doctor who saw none of themthe paper was read as follows.     chapter x. the substance of the shadow   i alexandre manette unfortunate physician native of beauvais and afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the bastille during the last month of the year . i write it at stolen intervals under every difficulty. i design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. some pitying hand may find it there when i and my sorrows are dust.  these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney mixed with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. hope has quite departed from my breast. i know from terrible warnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right mindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that i write the truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words whether they be ever read by men or not at the eternal judgmentseat.  one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think the twentysecond of the month in the year  i was walking on a retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air at an hours distance from my place of residence in the street of the school of medicine when a carriage came along behind me driven very fast. as i stood aside to let that carriage pass apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down a head was put out at the window and a voice called to the driver to stop.  the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses and the same voice called to me by my name. i answered. the carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before i came up with it.  i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to conceal themselves. as they stood side by side near the carriage door i also observed that they both looked of about my own age or rather younger and that they were greatly alike in stature manner voice and as far as i could see face too.  you are doctor manette said one.  i am.  doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other the young physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in paris  gentlemen i returned i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so graciously.  we have been to your residence said the first and not being so fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of overtaking you. will you please to enter the carriage  the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these words were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. they were armed. i was not.  gentlemen said i pardon me but i usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case to which i am summoned.  the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. doctor your clients are people of condition. as to the nature of the case our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. enough. will you please to enter the carriage  i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence. they both entered after methe last springing in after putting up the steps. the carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed.  i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. i have no doubt that it is word for word the same. i describe everything exactly as it took place constraining my mind not to wander from the task. where i make the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the time and put my paper in its hidingplace.            the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and emerged upon the country road. at twothirds of a league from the barrieri did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards when i traversed itit struck out of the main avenue and presently stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed to the door of the house. it was not opened immediately in answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the face.  there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. but the other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in like manner with his arm the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers.  from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. i was conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain lying on a bed.  the patient was a woman of great beauty and young assuredly not much past twenty. her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. i noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentlemans dress. on one of them which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw the armorial bearings of a noble and the letter e.  i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth and was in danger of suffocation. my first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing and in moving the scarf aside the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.  i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down and looked into her face. her eyes were dilated and wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeated the words my husband my father and my brother and then counted up to twelve and said hush for an instant and no more she would pause to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin again and she would repeat the cry my husband my father and my brother and would count up to twelve and say hush there was no variation in the order or the manner. there was no cessation but the regular moments pause in the utterance of these sounds.  how long i asked has this lasted  to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the younger by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority. it was the elder who replied since about this hour last night.  she has a husband a father and a brother  a brother.  i do not address her brother  he answered with great contempt no.  she has some recent association with the number twelve  the younger brother impatiently rejoined with twelve oclock  see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast how useless i am as you have brought me if i had known what i was coming to see i could have come provided. as it is time must be lost. there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.  the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily there is a case of medicines here and brought it from a closet and put it on the table.            i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my lips. if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those.  do you doubt them asked the younger brother.  you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no more.  i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many efforts the dose that i desired to give. as i intended to repeat it after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then sat down by the side of the bed. there was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance wife of the man downstairs who had retreated into a corner. the house was damp and decayed indifferently furnishedevidently recently occupied and temporarily used. some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deaden the sound of the shrieks. they continued to be uttered in their regular succession with the cry my husband my father and my brother the counting up to twelve and hush the frenzy was so violent that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms but i had looked to them to see that they were not painful. the only spark of encouragement in the case was that my hand upon the sufferers breast had this much soothing influence that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. it had no effect upon the cries no pendulum could be more regular.  for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers looking on before the elder said  there is another patient.  i was startled and asked is it a pressing case  you had better see he carelessly answered and took up a light.            the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase which was a species of loft over a stable. there was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it the rest was open to the ridge of the tiled roof and there were beams across. hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place fagots for firing and a heap of apples in sand. i had to pass through that part to get at the other. my memory is circumstantial and unshaken. i try it with these details and i see them all in this my cell in the bastille near the close of the tenth year of my captivity as i saw them all that night.  on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay a handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most. he lay on his back with his teeth set his right hand clenched on his breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. i could not see where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him but i could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.  i am a doctor my poor fellow said i. let me examine it.  i do not want it examined he answered let it be.  it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand away. the wound was a swordthrust received from twenty to twentyfour hours before but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. he was then dying fast. as i turned my eyes to the elder brother i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare or rabbit not at all as if he were a fellowcreature.  how has this been done monsieur said i.  a crazed young common dog a serf forced my brother to draw upon him and has fallen by my brothers swordlike a gentleman.  there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this answer. the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy or about his fate.  the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and they now slowly moved to me.  doctor they are very proud these nobles but we common dogs are proud too sometimes. they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us but we have a little pride left sometimes. shehave you seen her doctor  the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the distance. he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence.  i said i have seen her.  she is my sister doctor. they have had their shameful rights these nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years but we have had good girls among us. i know it and have heard my father say so. she was a good girl. she was betrothed to a good young man too a tenant of his. we were all tenants of histhat mans who stands there. the other is his brother the worst of a bad race.  it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.  we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common dogs are by those superior beingstaxed by him without mercy obliged to work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his mill obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat we ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closed that his people should not see it and take it from usi say we were so robbed and hunted and were made so poor that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and that what we should most pray for was that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out  i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth like a fire. i had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in the dying boy.  nevertheless doctor my sister married. he was ailing at that time poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and comfort him in our cottageour doghut as that man would call it. she had not been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her and admired her and asked that man to lend her to himfor what are husbands among us he was willing enough but my sister was good and virtuous and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. what did the two then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her willing  the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the lookeron and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true. the two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see even in this bastille the gentlemans all negligent indifference the peasants all troddendown sentiment and passionate revenge.  you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to harness us common dogs to carts and drive us. they so harnessed him and drove him. you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night and ordered him back into his harness in the day. but he was not persuaded. no taken out of harness one day at noon to feedif he could find foodhe sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the bell and died on her bosom.  nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. he forced back the gathering shadows of death as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and to cover his wound.  then with that mans permission and even with his aid his brother took her away in spite of what i know she must have told his brotherand what that is will not be long unknown to you doctor if it is nowhis brother took her awayfor his pleasure and diversion for a little while. i saw her pass me on the road. when i took the tidings home our fathers heart burst he never spoke one of the words that filled it. i took my young sister for i have another to a place beyond the reach of this man and where at least she will never be his vassal. then i tracked the brother here and last night climbed ina common dog but sword in hand.where is the loft window it was somewhere here  the room was darkening to his sight the world was narrowing around him. i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor as if there had been a struggle.  she heard me and ran in. i told her not to come near us till he was dead. he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money then struck at me with a whip. but i though a common dog so struck at him as to make him draw. let him break into as many pieces as he will the sword that he stained with my common blood he drew to defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life.  my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments of a broken sword lying among the hay. that weapon was a gentlemans. in another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers.  now lift me up doctor lift me up. where is he  he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking that he referred to the brother.  he proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me. where is the man who was here turn my face to him.  i did so raising the boys head against my knee. but invested for the moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely obliging me to rise too or i could not have still supported him.  marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide and his right hand raised in the days when all these things are to be answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad race to answer for them. i mark this cross of blood upon you as a sign that i do it. in the days when all these things are to be answered for i summon your brother the worst of the bad race to answer for them separately. i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that i do it.  twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. he stood for an instant with the finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him down dead.            when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. i knew that this might last for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.  i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. she never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. they were always my husband my father and my brother one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. hush  this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw her. i had come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began to falter. i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity and byandbye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead.  it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long and fearful storm. i released her arms and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. it was then that i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen and it was then that i lost the little hope i had had of her.  is she dead asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse.  not dead said i but like to die.  what strength there is in these common bodies he said looking down at her with some curiosity.  there is prodigious strength i answered him in sorrow and despair.  he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them. he moved a chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in a subdued voice  doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds i recommended that your aid should be invited. your reputation is high and as a young man with your fortune to make you are probably mindful of your interest. the things that you see here are things to be seen and not spoken of.  i listened to the patients breathing and avoided answering.  do you honour me with your attention doctor  monsieur said i in my profession the communications of patients are always received in confidence. i was guarded in my answer for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen.  her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried the pulse and the heart. there was life and no more. looking round as i resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me.            i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness that i must abridge this narrative. there is no confusion or failure in my memory it can recall and could detail every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.  she lingered for a week. towards the last i could understand some few syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to her lips. she asked me where she was and i told her who i was and i told her. it was in vain that i asked her for her family name. she faintly shook her head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done.  i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told the brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day. until then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there. but when it came to that they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her as ifthe thought passed through my mindi were dying too.  i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and that peasant a boy. the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family and was ridiculous. as often as i caught the younger brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply for knowing what i knew from the boy. he was smoother and more polite to me than the elder but i saw this. i also saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder too.  my patient died two hours before midnightat a time by my watch answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her. i was alone with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.  the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient to ride away. i had heard them alone at the bedside striking their boots with their ridingwhips and loitering up and down.  at last she is dead said the elder when i went in.  she is dead said i.  i congratulate you my brother were his words as he turned round.  he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking. he now gave me a rouleau of gold. i took it from his hand but laid it on the table. i had considered the question and had resolved to accept nothing.  pray excuse me said i. under the circumstances no.  they exchanged looks but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to them and we parted without another word on either side.            i am weary weary wearyworn down by misery. i cannot read what i have written with this gaunt hand.  early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box with my name on the outside. from the first i had anxiously considered what i ought to do. i decided that day to write privately to the minister stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been summoned and the place to which i had gone in effect stating all the circumstances. i knew what court influence was and what the immunities of the nobles were and i expected that the matter would never be heard of but i wished to relieve my own mind. i had kept the matter a profound secret even from my wife and this too i resolved to state in my letter. i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger but i was conscious that there might be danger for others if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed.  i was much engaged that day and could not complete my letter that night. i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. it was the last day of the year. the letter was lying before me just completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished to see me.            i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself. it is so cold so dark my senses are so benumbed and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.  the lady was young engaging and handsome but not marked for long life. she was in great agitation. she presented herself to me as the wife of the marquis st. evrmonde. i connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately.  my memory is still accurate but i cannot write the words of our conversation. i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was and i know not at what times i may be watched. she had in part suspected and in part discovered the main facts of the cruel story of her husbands share in it and my being resorted to. she did not know that the girl was dead. her hope had been she said in great distress to show her in secret a womans sympathy. her hope had been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many.  she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living and her greatest desire was to help that sister. i could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothing. her inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been the hope that i could tell her the name and place of abode. whereas to this wretched hour i am ignorant of both.            these scraps of paper fail me. one was taken from me with a warning yesterday. i must finish my record today.  she was a good compassionate lady and not happy in her marriage. how could she be the brother distrusted and disliked her and his influence was all opposed to her she stood in dread of him and in dread of her husband too. when i handed her down to the door there was a child a pretty boy from two to three years old in her carriage.  for his sake doctor she said pointing to him in tears i would do all i can to make what poor amends i can. he will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise. i have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this it will one day be required of him. what i have left to call my ownit is little beyond the worth of a few jewelsi will make it the first charge of his life to bestow with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother on this injured family if the sister can be discovered.  she kissed the boy and said caressing him it is for thine own dear sake. thou wilt be faithful little charles the child answered her bravely yes i kissed her hand and she took him in her arms and went away caressing him. i never saw her more.  as she had mentioned her husbands name in the faith that i knew it i added no mention of it to my letter. i sealed my letter and not trusting it out of my own hands delivered it myself that day.  that night the last night of the year towards nine oclock a man in a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softly followed my servant ernest defarge a youth upstairs. when my servant came into the room where i sat with my wifeo my wife beloved of my heart my fair young english wifewe saw the man who was supposed to be at the gate standing silent behind him.  an urgent case in the rue st. honore he said. it would not detain me he had a coach in waiting.  it brought me here it brought me to my grave. when i was clear of the house a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind and my arms were pinioned. the two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner and identified me with a single gesture. the marquis took from his pocket the letter i had written showed it me burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held and extinguished the ashes with his foot. not a word was spoken. i was brought here i was brought to my living grave.  if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers in all these frightful years to grant me any tidings of my dearest wifeso much as to let me know by a word whether alive or deadi might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them. but now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them and that they have no part in his mercies. and them and their descendants to the last of their race i alexandre manette unhappy prisoner do this last night of the year  in my unbearable agony denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. i denounce them to heaven and to earth.  a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. a sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.  little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to show how the defarges had not made the paper public with the other captured bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept it biding their time. little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by saint antoine and was wrought into the fatal register. the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day against such denunciation.  and all the worse for the doomed man that the denouncer was a wellknown citizen his own attached friend the father of his wife. one of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity and for sacrifices and selfimmolations on the peoples altar. therefore when the president said else had his own head quivered on his shoulders that the good physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan there was wild excitement patriotic fervour not a touch of human sympathy.  much influence around him has that doctor murmured madame defarge smiling to the vengeance. save him now my doctor save him  at every jurymans vote there was a roar. another and another. roar and roar.  unanimously voted. at heart and by descent an aristocrat an enemy of the republic a notorious oppressor of the people. back to the conciergerie and death within fourandtwenty hours     chapter xi. dusk   the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die fell under the sentence as if she had been mortally stricken. but she uttered no sound and so strong was the voice within her representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it that it quickly raised her even from that shock.  the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors the tribunal adjourned. the quick noise and movement of the courts emptying itself by many passages had not ceased when lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband with nothing in her face but love and consolation.  if i might touch him if i might embrace him once o good citizens if you would have so much compassion for us  there was but a gaoler left along with two of the four men who had taken him last night and barsad. the people had all poured out to the show in the streets. barsad proposed to the rest let her embrace him then it is but a moment. it was silently acquiesced in and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place where he by leaning over the dock could fold her in his arms.  farewell dear darling of my soul. my parting blessing on my love. we shall meet again where the weary are at rest  they were her husbands words as he held her to his bosom.  i can bear it dear charles. i am supported from above dont suffer for me. a parting blessing for our child.  i send it to her by you. i kiss her by you. i say farewell to her by you.  my husband. no a moment he was tearing himself apart from her. we shall not be separated long. i feel that this will break my heart byandbye but i will do my duty while i can and when i leave her god will raise up friends for her as he did for me.  her father had followed her and would have fallen on his knees to both of them but that darnay put out a hand and seized him crying  no no what have you done what have you done that you should kneel to us we know now what a struggle you made of old. we know now what you underwent when you suspected my descent and when you knew it. we know now the natural antipathy you strove against and conquered for her dear sake. we thank you with all our hearts and all our love and duty. heaven be with you  her fathers only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair and wring them with a shriek of anguish.  it could not be otherwise said the prisoner. all things have worked together as they have fallen out. it was the alwaysvain endeavour to discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. good could never come of such evil a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. be comforted and forgive me. heaven bless you  as he was drawn away his wife released him and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer and with a radiant look upon her face in which there was even a comforting smile. as he went out at the prisoners door she turned laid her head lovingly on her fathers breast tried to speak to him and fell at his feet.  then issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved sydney carton came and took her up. only her father and mr. lorry were with her. his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her head. yet there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat had a flush of pride in it.  shall i take her to a coach i shall never feel her weight.  he carried her lightly to the door and laid her tenderly down in a coach. her father and their old friend got into it and he took his seat beside the driver.  when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden he lifted her again and carried her up the staircase to their rooms. there he laid her down on a couch where her child and miss pross wept over her.  dont recall her to herself he said softly to the latter she is better so. dont revive her to consciousness while she only faints.  oh carton carton dear carton cried little lucie springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him in a burst of grief. now that you have come i think you will do something to help mamma something to save papa o look at her dear carton can you of all the people who love her bear to see her so  he bent over the child and laid her blooming cheek against his face. he put her gently from him and looked at her unconscious mother.  before i go he said and pausedi may kiss her  it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips he murmured some words. the child who was nearest to him told them afterwards and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady that she heard him say a life you love.  when he had gone out into the next room he turned suddenly on mr. lorry and her father who were following and said to the latter  you had great influence but yesterday doctor manette let it at least be tried. these judges and all the men in power are very friendly to you and very recognisant of your services are they not  nothing connected with charles was concealed from me. i had the strongest assurances that i should save him and i did. he returned the answer in great trouble and very slowly.  try them again. the hours between this and tomorrow afternoon are few and short but try.  i intend to try. i will not rest a moment.  thats well. i have known such energy as yours do great things before nowthough never he added with a smile and a sigh together such great things as this. but try of little worth as life is when we misuse it it is worth that effort. it would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.  i will go said doctor manette to the prosecutor and the president straight and i will go to others whom it is better not to name. i will write too andbut stay there is a celebration in the streets and no one will be accessible until dark.  thats true. well it is a forlorn hope at the best and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark. i should like to know how you speed though mind i expect nothing when are you likely to have seen these dread powers doctor manette  immediately after dark i should hope. within an hour or two from this.  it will be dark soon after four. let us stretch the hour or two. if i go to mr. lorrys at nine shall i hear what you have done either from our friend or from yourself  yes.  may you prosper  mr. lorry followed sydney to the outer door and touching him on the shoulder as he was going away caused him to turn.  i have no hope said mr. lorry in a low and sorrowful whisper.  nor have i.  if any one of these men or all of these men were disposed to spare himwhich is a large supposition for what is his life or any mans to themi doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.  and so do i. i heard the fall of the axe in that sound.  mr. lorry leaned his arm upon the doorpost and bowed his face upon it.  dont despond said carton very gently dont grieve. i encouraged doctor manette in this idea because i felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. otherwise she might think his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted and that might trouble her.  yes yes yes returned mr. lorry drying his eyes you are right. but he will perish there is no real hope.  yes. he will perish there is no real hope echoed carton.  and walked with a settled step downstairs.     chapter xii. darkness   sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go. at tellsons bankinghouse at nine he said with a musing face. shall i do well in the mean time to show myself i think so. it is best that these people should know there is such a man as i here it is a sound precaution and may be a necessary preparation. but care care care let me think it out  checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took a turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. his first impression was confirmed. it is best he said finally resolved that these people should know there is such a man as i here. and he turned his face towards saint antoine.  defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wineshop in the saint antoine suburb. it was not difficult for one who knew the city well to find his house without asking any question. having ascertained its situation carton came out of those closer streets again and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. for the first time in many years he had no strong drink. since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mr. lorrys hearth like a man who had done with it.  it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out into the streets again. as he passed along towards saint antoine he stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coatcollar and his wild hair. this done he went on direct to defarges and went in.  there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. this man whom he had seen upon the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the defarges man and wife. the vengeance assisted in the conversation like a regular member of the establishment.  as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered.  he repeated what he had already said.  english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.  after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word were slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong foreign accent. yes madame yes. i am english  madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evrmonde  defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening.  how  good evening.  oh good evening citizen filling his glass. ah and good wine. i drink to the republic.  defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like.  madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like. jacques three pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind see you madame.  the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faith and you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more tomorrow  carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slow forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face. they were all leaning their arms on the counter close together speaking low. after a silence of a few moments during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor they resumed their conversation.  it is true what madame says observed jacques three. why stop there is great force in that. why stop  well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere. after all the question is still where  at extermination said madame.  magnificent croaked jacques three. the vengeance also highly approved.  extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather troubled in general i say nothing against it. but this doctor has suffered much you have seen him today you have observed his face when the paper was read.  i have observed his face repeated madame contemptuously and angrily. yes. i have observed his face. i have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the republic. let him take care of his face  and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him  i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i have observed his daughter more times than one. i have observed her today and i have observed her other days. i have observed her in the court and i have observed her in the street by the prison. let me but lift my finger she seemed to raise it the listeners eyes were always on his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her as if the axe had dropped.  the citizeness is superb croaked the juryman.  she is an angel said the vengeance and embraced her.  as to thee pursued madame implacably addressing her husband if it depended on theewhich happily it does notthou wouldst rescue this man even now.  no protested defarge. not if to lift this glass would do it but i would leave the matter there. i say stop there.  see you then jacques said madame defarge wrathfully and see you too my little vengeance see you both listen for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on my register doomed to destruction and extermination. ask my husband is that so.  it is so assented defarge without being asked.  in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls he finds this paper of today and he brings it home and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut we read it here on this spot by the light of this lamp. ask him is that so.  it is so assented defarge.  that night i tell him when the paper is read through and the lamp is burnt out and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars that i have now a secret to communicate. ask him is that so.  it is so assented defarge again.  i communicate to him that secret. i smite this bosom with these two hands as i smite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought up among the fishermen of the seashore and that peasant family so injured by the two evrmonde brothers as that bastille paper describes is my family. defarge that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister that husband was my sisters husband that unborn child was their child that brother was my brother that father was my father those dead are my dead and that summons to answer for those things descends to me ask him is that so.  it is so assented defarge once more.  then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame but dont tell me.  both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was without seeing herand both highly commended it. defarge a weak minority interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. tell the wind and the fire where to stop not me  customers entered and the group was broken up. the english customer paid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and asked as a stranger to be directed towards the national palace. madame defarge took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road. the english customer was not without his reflections then that it might be a good deed to seize that arm lift it and strike under it sharp and deep.  but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present himself in mr. lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. he said he had been with lucie until just now and had only left her for a few minutes to come and keep his appointment. her father had not been seen since he quitted the bankinghouse towards four oclock. she had some faint hopes that his mediation might save charles but they were very slight. he had been more than five hours gone where could he be  mr. lorry waited until ten but doctor manette not returning and he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged that he should go back to her and come to the bankinghouse again at midnight. in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor.  he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve but doctor manette did not come back. mr. lorry returned and found no tidings of him and brought none. where could he be  they were discussing this question and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him on the stairs. the instant he entered the room it was plain that all was lost.  whether he had really been to any one or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets was never known. as he stood staring at them they asked him no question for his face told them everything.  i cannot find it said he and i must have it. where is it  his head and throat were bare and as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on the floor.  where is my bench i have been looking everywhere for my bench and i cant find it. what have they done with my work time presses i must finish those shoes.  they looked at one another and their hearts died within them.  come come said he in a whimpering miserable way let me get to work. give me my work.  receiving no answer he tore his hair and beat his feet upon the ground like a distracted child.  dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with a dreadful cry but give me my work what is to become of us if those shoes are not done tonight  lost utterly lost  it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder and soothed him to sit down before the fire with a promise that he should have his work presently. he sank into the chair and brooded over the embers and shed tears. as if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy or a dream mr. lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping.  affected and impressed with terror as they both were by this spectacle of ruin it was not a time to yield to such emotions. his lonely daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed to them both too strongly. again as if by agreement they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. carton was the first to speak  the last chance is gone it was not much. yes he had better be taken to her. but before you go will you for a moment steadily attend to me dont ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make and exact the promise i am going to exact i have a reasona good one.  i do not doubt it answered mr. lorry. say on.  the figure in the chair between them was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro and moaning. they spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sickbed in the night.  carton stooped to pick up the coat which lay almost entangling his feet. as he did so a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on the floor. carton took it up and there was a folded paper in it. we should look at this he said. mr. lorry nodded his consent. he opened it and exclaimed thank god  what is it asked mr. lorry eagerly.  a moment let me speak of it in its place. first he put his hand in his coat and took another paper from it that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. look at it. you seesydney carton an englishman  mr. lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face.  keep it for me until tomorrow. i shall see him tomorrow you remember and i had better not take it into the prison.  why not  i dont know i prefer not to do so. now take this paper that doctor manette has carried about him. it is a similar certificate enabling him and his daughter and her child at any time to pass the barrier and the frontier you see  yes  perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil yesterday. when is it dated but no matter dont stay to look put it up carefully with mine and your own. now observe i never doubted until within this hour or two that he had or could have such a paper. it is good until recalled. but it may be soon recalled and i have reason to think will be.  they are not in danger  they are in great danger. they are in danger of denunciation by madame defarge. i know it from her own lips. i have overheard words of that womans tonight which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. i have lost no time and since then i have seen the spy. he confirms me. he knows that a woodsawyer living by the prison wall is under the control of the defarges and has been rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen herhe never mentioned lucies namemaking signs and signals to prisoners. it is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one a prison plot and that it will involve her lifeand perhaps her childsand perhaps her fathersfor both have been seen with her at that place. dont look so horrified. you will save them all.  heaven grant i may carton but how  i am going to tell you how. it will depend on you and it could depend on no better man. this new denunciation will certainly not take place until after tomorrow probably not until two or three days afterwards more probably a week afterwards. you know it is a capital crime to mourn for or sympathise with a victim of the guillotine. she and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime and this woman the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described would wait to add that strength to her case and make herself doubly sure. you follow me  so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say that for the moment i lose sight touching the back of the doctors chair even of this distress.  you have money and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. your preparations have been completed for some days to return to england. early tomorrow have your horses ready so that they may be in starting trim at two oclock in the afternoon.  it shall be done  his manner was so fervent and inspiring that mr. lorry caught the flame and was as quick as youth.  you are a noble heart. did i say we could depend upon no better man tell her tonight what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father. dwell upon that for she would lay her own fair head beside her husbands cheerfully. he faltered for an instant then went on as before. for the sake of her child and her father press upon her the necessity of leaving paris with them and you at that hour. tell her that it was her husbands last arrangement. tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe or hope. you think that her father even in this sad state will submit himself to her do you not  i am sure of it.  i thought so. quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. the moment i come to you take me in and drive away.  i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances  you have my certificate in your hand with the rest you know and will reserve my place. wait for nothing but to have my place occupied and then for england  why then said mr. lorry grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand it does not all depend on one old man but i shall have a young and ardent man at my side.  by the help of heaven you shall promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another.  nothing carton.  remember these words tomorrow change the course or delay in itfor any reasonand no life can possibly be saved and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.  i will remember them. i hope to do my part faithfully.  and i hope to do mine. now good bye  though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness and though he even put the old mans hand to his lips he did not part from him then. he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers as to get a cloak and hat put upon it and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have. he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heartso happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to itoutwatched the awful night. he entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone looking up at the light in the window of her room. before he went away he breathed a blessing towards it and a farewell.     chapter xiii. fiftytwo   in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the day awaited their fate. they were in number as the weeks of the year. fiftytwo were to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. before their cells were quit of them new occupants were appointed before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set apart.  two score and twelve were told off. from the farmergeneral of seventy whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. physical diseases engendered in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims of all degrees and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable suffering intolerable oppression and heartless indifference smote equally without distinction.  charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal. in every line of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation. he had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that units could avail him nothing.  nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him to compose his mind to what it must bear. his hold on life was strong and it was very very hard to loosen by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter there and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded this was closed again. there was a hurry too in all his thoughts a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended against resignation. if for a moment he did feel resigned then his wife and child who had to live after him seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.  but all this was at first. before long the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went the same road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang up to stimulate him. next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet fortitude. so by degrees he calmed into the better state when he could raise his thoughts much higher and draw comfort down.  before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had travelled thus far on his last way. being allowed to purchase the means of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.  he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had known nothing of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it from herself and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and uncles responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read. he had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished was the one conditionfully intelligible nowthat her father had attached to their betrothal and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. he entreated her for her fathers sake never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper or had had it recalled to him for the moment or for good by the story of the tower on that old sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden. if he had preserved any definite remembrance of it there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there and which had been described to all the world. he besought herthough he added that he knew it was needlessto console her father by impressing him through every tender means she could think of with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing and her overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their dear child he adjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her father.  to her father himself he wrote in the same strain but he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. and he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.  to mr. lorry he commended them all and explained his worldly affairs. that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment all was done. he never thought of carton. his mind was so full of the others that he never once thought of him.  he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. when he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world.  but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining forms. free and happy back in the old house in soho though it had nothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and light of heart he was with lucie again and she told him it was all a dream and he had never gone away. a pause of forgetfulness and then he had even suffered and had come back to her dead and at peace and yet there was no difference in him. another pause of oblivion and he awoke in the sombre morning unconscious where he was or what had happened until it flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death  thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fiftytwo heads were to fall. and now while he was composed and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his waking thoughts which was very difficult to master.  he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. how high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he would be stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would be dyed red which way his face would be turned whether he would be the first or might be the last these and many similar questions in nowise directed by his will obtruded themselves over and over again countless times. neither were they connected with fear he was conscious of no fear. rather they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his than his own.  the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. nine gone for ever ten gone for ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away. after a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him he had got the better of it. he walked up and down softly repeating their names to himself. the worst of the strife was over. he could walk up and down free from distracting fancies praying for himself and for them.  twelve gone for ever.  he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. therefore he resolved to keep two before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others.  walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast a very different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at la force he heard one struck away from him without surprise. the hour had measured like most other hours. devoutly thankful to heaven for his recovered selfpossession he thought there is but another now and turned to walk again.  footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. he stopped.  the key was put in the lock and turned. before the door was opened or as it opened a man said in a low voice in english he has never seen me here i have kept out of his way. go you in alone i wait near. lose no time  the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on his features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton.  there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for the first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining. but he spoke and it was his voice he took the prisoners hand and it was his real grasp.  of all the people upon earth you least expected to see me he said.  i could not believe it to be you. i can scarcely believe it now. you are notthe apprehension came suddenly into his minda prisoner  no. i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here and in virtue of it i stand before you. i come from heryour wife dear darnay.  the prisoner wrung his hand.  i bring you a request from her.  what is it  a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well remember.  the prisoner turned his face partly aside.  you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means i have no time to tell you. you must comply with ittake off those boots you wear and draw on these of mine.  there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisoner. carton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightning got him down into it and stood over him barefoot.  draw on these boots of mine. put your hands to them put your will to them. quick  carton there is no escaping from this place it never can be done. you will only die with me. it is madness.  it would be madness if i asked you to escape but do i when i ask you to pass out at that door tell me it is madness and remain here. change that cravat for this of mine that coat for this of mine. while you do it let me take this ribbon from your hair and shake out your hair like this of mine  with wonderful quickness and with a strength both of will and action that appeared quite supernatural he forced all these changes upon him. the prisoner was like a young child in his hands.  carton dear carton it is madness. it cannot be accomplished it never can be done it has been attempted and has always failed. i implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.  do i ask you my dear darnay to pass the door when i ask that refuse. there are pen and ink and paper on this table. is your hand steady enough to write  it was when you came in.  steady it again and write what i shall dictate. quick friend quick  pressing his hand to his bewildered head darnay sat down at the table. carton with his right hand in his breast stood close beside him.  write exactly as i speak.  to whom do i address it  to no one. carton still had his hand in his breast.  do i date it  no.  the prisoner looked up at each question. carton standing over him with his hand in his breast looked down.  if you remember said carton dictating the words that passed between us long ago you will readily comprehend this when you see it. you do remember them i know. it is not in your nature to forget them.  he was drawing his hand from his breast the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote the hand stopped closing upon something.  have you written forget them carton asked.  i have. is that a weapon in your hand  no i am not armed.  what is it in your hand  you shall know directly. write on there are but a few words more. he dictated again. i am thankful that the time has come when i can prove them. that i do so is no subject for regret or grief. as he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writers face.  the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he looked about him vacantly.  what vapour is that he asked.  vapour  something that crossed me  i am conscious of nothing there can be nothing here. take up the pen and finish. hurry hurry  as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. as he looked at carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing cartonhis hand again in his breastlooked steadily at him.  hurry hurry  the prisoner bent over the paper once more.  if it had been otherwise cartons hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down i never should have used the longer opportunity. if it had been otherwise the hand was at the prisoners face i should but have had so much the more to answer for. if it had been otherwise carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.  cartons hand moved back to his breast no more. the prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look but cartons hand was close and firm at his nostrils and cartons left arm caught him round the waist. for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him but within a minute or so he was stretched insensible on the ground.  quickly but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside combed back his hair and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. then he softly called enter there come in and the spy presented himself.  you see said carton looking up as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure putting the paper in the breast is your hazard very great  mr. carton the spy answered with a timid snap of his fingers my hazard is not that in the thick of business here if you are true to the whole of your bargain.  dont fear me. i will be true to the death.  you must be mr. carton if the tale of fiftytwo is to be right. being made right by you in that dress i shall have no fear.  have no fear i shall soon be out of the way of harming you and the rest will soon be far from here please god now get assistance and take me to the coach.  you said the spy nervously.  him man with whom i have exchanged. you go out at the gate by which you brought me in  of course.  i was weak and faint when you brought me in and i am fainter now you take me out. the parting interview has overpowered me. such a thing has happened here often and too often. your life is in your own hands. quick call assistance  you swear not to betray me said the trembling spy as he paused for a last moment.  man man returned carton stamping his foot have i sworn by no solemn vow already to go through with this that you waste the precious moments now take him yourself to the courtyard you know of place him yourself in the carriage show him yourself to mr. lorry tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air and to remember my words of last night and his promise of last night and drive away  the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his forehead on his hands. the spy returned immediately with two men.  how then said one of them contemplating the fallen figure. so afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of sainte guillotine  a good patriot said the other could hardly have been more afflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank.  they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they had brought to the door and bent to carry it away.  the time is short evrmonde said the spy in a warning voice.  i know it well answered carton. be careful of my friend i entreat you and leave me.  come then my children said barsad. lift him and come away  the door closed and carton was left alone. straining his powers of listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. there was none. keys turned doors clashed footsteps passed along distant passages no cry was raised or hurry made that seemed unusual. breathing more freely in a little while he sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two.  sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then began to be audible. several doors were opened in succession and finally his own. a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in merely saying follow me evrmonde and he followed into a large dark room at a distance. it was a dark winter day and what with the shadows within and what with the shadows without he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. some were standing some seated. some were lamenting and in restless motion but these were few. the great majority were silent and still looking fixedly at the ground.  as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fiftytwo were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace him as having a knowledge of him. it thrilled him with a great dread of discovery but the man went on. a very few moments after that a young woman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting and came to speak to him.  citizen evrmonde she said touching him with her cold hand. i am a poor little seamstress who was with you in la force.  he murmured for answer true. i forget what you were accused of  plots. though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any. is it likely who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me  the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tears started from his eyes.  i am not afraid to die citizen evrmonde but i have done nothing. i am not unwilling to die if the republic which is to do so much good to us poor will profit by my death but i do not know how that can be citizen evrmonde. such a poor weak little creature  as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.  i heard you were released citizen evrmonde. i hoped it was true  it was. but i was again taken and condemned.  if i may ride with you citizen evrmonde will you let me hold your hand i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will give me more courage.  as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in them and then astonishment. he pressed the workworn hungerworn young fingers and touched his lips.  are you dying for him she whispered.  and his wife and child. hush yes.  o you will let me hold your brave hand stranger  hush yes my poor sister to the last.            the same shadows that are falling on the prison are falling in that same hour of the early afternoon on the barrier with the crowd about it when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined.  who goes here whom have we within papers  the papers are handed out and read.  alexandre manette. physician. french. which is he  this is he this helpless inarticulately murmuring wandering old man pointed out.  apparently the citizendoctor is not in his right mind the revolutionfever will have been too much for him  greatly too much for him.  hah many suffer with it. lucie. his daughter. french. which is she  this is she.  apparently it must be. lucie the wife of evrmonde is it not  it is.  hah evrmonde has an assignation elsewhere. lucie her child. english. this is she  she and no other.  kiss me child of evrmonde. now thou hast kissed a good republican something new in thy family remember it sydney carton. advocate. english. which is he  he lies here in this corner of the carriage. he too is pointed out.  apparently the english advocate is in a swoon  it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. it is represented that he is not in strong health and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the republic.  is that all it is not a great deal that many are under the displeasure of the republic and must look out at the little window. jarvis lorry. banker. english. which is he  i am he. necessarily being the last.  it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. it is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door replying to a group of officials. they leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof the countrypeople hanging about press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in a little child carried by its mother has its short arm held out for it that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine.  behold your papers jarvis lorry countersigned.  one can depart citizen  one can depart. forward my postilions a good journey  i salute you citizens.and the first danger passed  these are again the words of jarvis lorry as he clasps his hands and looks upward. there is terror in the carriage there is weeping there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.  are we not going too slowly can they not be induced to go faster  asks lucie clinging to the old man.  it would seem like flight my darling. i must not urge them too much it would rouse suspicion.  look back look back and see if we are pursued  the road is clear my dearest. so far we are not pursued.  houses in twos and threes pass by us solitary farms ruinous buildings dyeworks tanneries and the like open country avenues of leafless trees. the hard uneven pavement is under us the soft deep mud is on either side. sometimes we strike into the skirting mud to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us sometimes we stick in ruts and sloughs there. the agony of our impatience is then so great that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and runninghidingdoing anything but stopping.  out of the open country in again among ruinous buildings solitary farms dyeworks tanneries and the like cottages in twos and threes avenues of leafless trees. have these men deceived us and taken us back by another road is not this the same place twice over thank heaven no. a village. look back look back and see if we are pursued hush the postinghouse.  leisurely our four horses are taken out leisurely the coach stands in the little street bereft of horses and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again leisurely the new horses come into visible existence one by one leisurely the new postilions follow sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips leisurely the old postilions count their money make wrong additions and arrive at dissatisfied results. all the time our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.  at length the new postilions are in their saddles and the old are left behind. we are through the village up the hill and down the hill and on the low watery grounds. suddenly the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation and the horses are pulled up almost on their haunches. we are pursued  ho within the carriage there. speak then  what is it asks mr. lorry looking out at window.  how many did they say  i do not understand you.  at the last post. how many to the guillotine today  fiftytwo.  i said so a brave number my fellowcitizen here would have it fortytwo ten more heads are worth having. the guillotine goes handsomely. i love it. hi forward. whoop  the night comes on dark. he moves more he is beginning to revive and to speak intelligibly he thinks they are still together he asks him by his name what he has in his hand. o pity us kind heaven and help us look out look out and see if we are pursued.  the wind is rushing after us and the clouds are flying after us and the moon is plunging after us and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us but so far we are pursued by nothing else.     chapter xiv. the knitting done   in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited their fate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and jacques three of the revolutionary jury. not in the wineshop did madame defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the woodsawyer erst a mender of roads. the sawyer himself did not participate in the conference but abided at a little distance like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required or to offer an opinion until invited.  but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good republican eh  there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill notes in france.  peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak. my husband fellowcitizen is a good republican and a bold man he has deserved well of the republic and possesses its confidence. but my husband has his weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor.  it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his head with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth it is not quite like a good citizen it is a thing to regret.  see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i. he may wear his head or lose it for any interest i have in him it is all one to me. but the evrmonde people are to be exterminated and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.  she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three. i have seen blue eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson held them up. ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure.  madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little.  the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment of his words has golden hair and blue eyes. and we seldom have a child there. it is a pretty sight  in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction i cannot trust my husband in this matter. not only do i feel since last night that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning and then they might escape.  that must never be croaked jacques three no one must escape. we have not half enough as it is. we ought to have six score a day.  in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason for regarding this doctor with any sensibility. i must act for myself therefore. come hither little citizen.  the woodsawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap.  touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bear witness to them this very day  ay ay why not cried the sawyer. every day in all weathers from two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one sometimes without. i know what i know. i have seen with my eyes.  he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.  clearly plots said jacques three. transparently  there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.  rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness. i answer for my fellowjurymen.  now let me see said madame defarge pondering again. yet once more can i spare this doctor to my husband i have no feeling either way. can i spare him  he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice. we really have not heads enough it would be a pity i think.  he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge i cannot speak of one without the other and i must not be silent and trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here. for i am not a bad witness.  the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be a celestial witness.  he must take his chance said madame defarge. no i cannot spare him you are engaged at three oclock you are going to see the batch of today executed.you  the question was addressed to the woodsawyer who hurriedly replied in the affirmative seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of republicans and that he would be in effect the most desolate of republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of madame defarges head of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety every hour in the day.  i said madame am equally engaged at the same place. after it is oversay at eight tonightcome you to me in saint antoine and we will give information against these people at my section.  the woodsawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. the citizeness looking at him he became embarrassed evaded her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among his wood and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.  madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to the door and there expounded her further views to them thus  she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death. she will be mourning and grieving. she will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the republic. she will be full of sympathy with its enemies. i will go to her.  what an admirable woman what an adorable woman exclaimed jacques three rapturously. ah my cherished cried the vengeance and embraced her.  take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat. keep me my usual chair. go you there straight for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual today.  i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with alacrity and kissing her cheek. you will not be late  i shall be there before the commencement.  and before the tumbrils arrive. be sure you are there my soul said the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the street before the tumbrils arrive  madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the mud and round the corner of the prison wall. the vengeance and the juryman looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments.  there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the streets. of a strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities the troubled time would have heaved her up under any circumstances. but imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong and an inveterate hatred of a class opportunity had developed her into a tigress. she was absolutely without pity. if she had ever had the virtue in her it had quite gone out of her.  it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers she saw not him but them. it was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan that was insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies and her prey and as such had no right to live. to appeal to her was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself. if she had been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself nor if she had been ordered to the axe tomorrow would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.  such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe. carelessly worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. lying hidden in her bosom was a loaded pistol. lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened dagger. thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood barefoot and barelegged on the brown seasand madame defarge took her way along the streets.  now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last night the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr. lorrys attention. it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers should be reduced to the utmost since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. finally he had proposed after anxious consideration that miss pross and jerry who were at liberty to leave the city should leave it at three oclock in the lightestwheeled conveyance known to that period. unencumbered with luggage they would soon overtake the coach and passing it and preceding it on the road would order its horses in advance and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night when delay was the most to be dreaded.  seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy. she and jerry had beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the elsedeserted lodging in which they held their consultation.  now what do you think mr. cruncher said miss pross whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or move or live what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard another carriage having already gone from here today it might awaken suspicion.  my opinion miss returned mr. cruncher is as youre right. likewise wot ill stand by you right or wrong.  i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures said miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any plan. are you capable of forming any plan my dear good mr. cruncher  respectin a future spear o life miss returned mr. cruncher i hope so. respectin any present use o this here blessed old head o mine i think not. would you do me the favour miss to take notice o two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis  oh for gracious sake cried miss pross still wildly crying record them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man.  first said mr. cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this never no more will i do it never no more  i am quite sure mr. cruncher returned miss pross that you never will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.  no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you. second them poor things well out o this and never no more will i interfere with mrs. crunchers flopping never no more  whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be said miss pross striving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it is best that mrs. cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.o my poor darlings  i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded mr. cruncher with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my words be took down and took to mrs. cruncher through yourselfthat wot my opinions respectin flopping has undergone a change and that wot i only hope with all my heart as mrs. cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.  there there there i hope she is my dear man cried the distracted miss pross and i hope she finds it answering her expectations.  forbid it proceeded mr. cruncher with additional solemnity additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now forbid it as we shouldnt all flop if it was anyways conwenient to get em out o this here dismal risk forbid it miss wot i say forbid it this was mr. crunchers conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.  and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer and nearer.  if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may rely upon my telling mrs. cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. now pray let us think my esteemed mr. cruncher let us think  still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer and nearer.  if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me wouldnt that be best  mr. cruncher thought it might be best.  where could you wait for me asked miss pross.  mr. cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but temple bar. alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed.  by the cathedral door said miss pross. would it be much out of the way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two towers  no miss answered mr. cruncher.  then like the best of men said miss pross go to the postinghouse straight and make that change.  i am doubtful said mr. cruncher hesitating and shaking his head about leaving of you you see. we dont know what may happen.  heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for me. take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as you can and i am sure it will be better than our going from here. i feel certain of it. there bless you mr. cruncher thinknot of me but of the lives that may depend on both of us  this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his decided mr. cruncher. with an encouraging nod or two he immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.  the having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution was a great relief to miss pross. the necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets was another relief. she looked at her watch and it was twenty minutes past two. she had no time to lose but must get ready at once.  afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the deserted rooms and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes which were swollen and red. haunted by her feverish apprehensions she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out for she saw a figure standing in the room.  the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge. by strange stern ways and through much staining blood those feet had come to meet that water.  madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evrmonde where is she  it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standing open and would suggest the flight. her first act was to shut them. there were four in the room and she shut them all. she then placed herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied.  madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement and rested on her when it was finished. miss pross had nothing beautiful about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness of her appearance but she too was a determined woman in her different way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes every inch.  you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss pross in her breathing. nevertheless you shall not get the better of me. i am an englishwoman.  madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of miss prosss own perception that they two were at bay. she saw a tight hard wiry woman before her as mr. lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand in the years gone by. she knew full well that miss pross was the familys devoted friend miss pross knew full well that madame defarge was the familys malevolent enemy.  on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing. i wish to see her.  i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may depend upon it ill hold my own against them.  each spoke in her own language neither understood the others words both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner what the unintelligible words meant.  it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment said madame defarge. good patriots will know what that means. let me see her. go tell her that i wish to see her. do you hear  if those eyes of yours were bedwinches returned miss pross and i was an english fourposter they shouldnt loose a splinter of me. no you wicked foreign woman i am your match.  madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.  woman imbecile and piglike said madame defarge frowning. i take no answer from you. i demand to see her. either tell her that i demand to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her  this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.  i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to understand your nonsensical language but i would give all i have except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or any part of it.  neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes. madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her but she now advanced one step.  i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate. i dont care an english twopence for myself. i know that the longer i keep you here the greater hope there is for my ladybird. ill not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me  thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath. thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life.  but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. this was a courage that madame defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. ha ha she laughed you poor wretch what are you worth i address myself to that doctor. then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor wife of evrmonde child of evrmonde any person but this miserable fool answer the citizeness defarge  perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone. three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in.  those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing there are odds and ends upon the ground. there is no one in that room behind you let me look.  never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as madame defarge understood the answer.  if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and brought back said madame defarge to herself.  as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you are uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself and you shall not know that if i can prevent your knowing it and know that or not know that you shall not leave here while i can hold you.  i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said madame defarge.  we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard we are not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling said miss pross.  madame defarge made at the door. miss pross on the instinct of the moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her tight. it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike miss pross with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her face but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.  soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled waist. it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered tones you shall not draw it. i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it. i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies  madame defarges hands were at her bosom. miss pross looked up saw what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood aloneblinded with smoke.  all this was in a second. as the smoke cleared leaving an awful stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.  in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed the body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help. happily she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did in time to check herself and go back. it was dreadful to go in at the door again but she did go in and even went near it to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. these she put on out on the staircase first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry and then got up and hurried away.  by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. by good fortune too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. she needed both advantages for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.  in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river. arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to prison and charged with murder in the midst of these fluttering thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away.  is there any noise in the streets she asked him.  the usual noises mr. cruncher replied and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.  i dont hear you said miss pross. what do you say  it was in vain for mr. cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross could not hear him. so ill nod my head thought mr. cruncher amazed at all events shell see that. and she did.  is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again presently.  again mr. cruncher nodded his head.  i dont hear it.  gone deaf in an hour said mr. cruncher ruminating with his mind much disturbed wots come to her  i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life.  blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr. cruncher more and more disturbed. wot can she have been a takin to keep her courage up hark theres the roll of them dreadful carts you can hear that miss  i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her nothing. o my good man there was first a great crash and then a great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.  if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh their journeys end said mr. cruncher glancing over his shoulder its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.  and indeed she never did.     chapter xv. the footsteps die out for ever   along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh. six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine. all the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine. and yet there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. crush humanity out of shape once more under similar hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.  six tumbrils roll along the streets. change these back again to what they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving peasants no the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations. if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along.  as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go steadily onward. so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils. here and there the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday and who there the day before.  of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. some seated with drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres and in pictures. several close their eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together. only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to dance. not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to the pity of the people.  there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked some question. it would seem to be always the same question for it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it with their swords. the leading curiosity is to know which is he he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart and holds his hand. he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him and always speaks to the girl. here and there in the long street of st. honore cries are raised against him. if they move him at all it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. he cannot easily touch his face his arms being bound.  on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils stands the spy and prisonsheep. he looks into the first of them not there. he looks into the second not there. he already asks himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks into the third.  which is evrmonde says a man behind him.  that. at the back there.  with his hand in the girls  yes.  the man cries down evrmonde to the guillotine all aristocrats down evrmonde  hush hush the spy entreats him timidly.  and why not citizen  he is going to pay the forfeit it will be paid in five minutes more. let him be at peace.  but the man continuing to exclaim down evrmonde the face of evrmonde is for a moment turned towards him. evrmonde then sees the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way.  the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution and end. the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following to the guillotine. in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting. on one of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her friend.  thrse she cries in her shrill tones. who has seen her thrse defarge  she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood.  no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly. thrse.  louder the woman recommends.  ay louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear thee. louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet it will hardly bring her. send other women up and down to seek her lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her  bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair and here are the tumbrils and evrmonde will be despatched in a wink and she not here see her knitting in my hand and her empty chair ready for her. i cry with vexation and disappointment  as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads. the ministers of sainte guillotine are robed and ready. crasha head is held up and the knittingwomen who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak count one.  the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up. crashand the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work count two.  the supposed evrmonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out next after him. he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out but still holds it as he promised. he gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls and she looks into his face and thanks him.  but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might have hope and comfort here today. i think you were sent to me by heaven.  or you to me says sydney carton. keep your eyes upon me dear child and mind no other object.  i mind nothing while i hold your hand. i shall mind nothing when i let it go if they are rapid.  they will be rapid. fear not  the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak as if they were alone. eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway to repair home together and to rest in her bosom.  brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last question i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little.  tell me what it is.  i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i love very dearly. she is five years younger than i and she lives in a farmers house in the south country. poverty parted us and she knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how should i tell her it is better as it is.  yes yes better as it is.  what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she may live a long time she may even live to be old.  what then my gentle sister  do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and tremble that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered  it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble there.  you comfort me so much i am so ignorant. am i to kiss you now is the moment come  yes.  she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other. the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face. she goes next before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo.  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.  the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water all flashes away. twentythree.            they said of him about the city that night that it was the peacefullest mans face ever beheld there. many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.  one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. if he had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would have been these  i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument before it shall cease out of its present use. i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.  i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more. i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name. i see her father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all men in his healing office and at peace. i see the good old man so long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has and passing tranquilly to his reward.  i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants generations hence. i see her an old woman weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. i see her and her husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the others soul than i was in the souls of both.  i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. i see him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. i see the blots i threw upon it faded away. i see him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this placethen fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurementand i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering voice.  it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known.

       " ' wuthering heights      wuthering heights  by emily bront     chapter i   i have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with. this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. a perfect misanthropists heavenand mr. heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still further in his waistcoat as i announced my name.  mr. heathcliff i said.  a nod was the answer.  mr. lockwood your new tenant sir. i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts  thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing. i should not allow any one to inconvenience me if i could hinder itwalk in  the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.  when he saw my horses breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the courtjoseph take mr. lockwoods horse and bring up some wine.  here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order. no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only hedgecutters.  joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy. the lord help us he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.  wuthering heights is the name of mr. heathcliffs dwelling. wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun. happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones.  before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date  and the name hareton earnshaw. i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.  one step brought us into the family sittingroom without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently. it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof. the latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it. above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horsepistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs highbacked primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge livercoloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses.  the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in kneebreeches and gaiters. such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner. but mr. heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. he is a darkskinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose. possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of underbred pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feelingto manifestations of mutual kindliness. hell love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. no im running on too fast i bestow my own attributes overliberally on him. mr. heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouldbe acquaintance to those which actuate me. let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.  while enjoying a month of fine weather at the seacoast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me. i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks. and what did i do i confess it with shameshrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and farther till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp.  by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate.  i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch. my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl.  youd better let the dog alone growled mr. heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. shes not accustomed to be spoilednot kept for a pet. then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph  joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me visvis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheepdogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us. this proceeding aroused the whole hive halfadozen fourfooted fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre. i felt my heels and coatlaps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in reestablishing peace.  mr. heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with tuckedup gown bare arms and fireflushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a fryingpan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene.  what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.  what the devil indeed i muttered. the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir. you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers  they wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table. the dogs do right to be vigilant. take a glass of wine  no thank you.  not bitten are you  if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter. heathcliffs countenance relaxed into a grin.  come come he said you are flurried mr. lockwood. here take a little wine. guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them. your health sir  i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since his humour took that turn. heprobably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenantrelaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to mea discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow. he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. i shall go notwithstanding. it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him.     chapter ii   yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights. on coming up from dinner however n.b.i dine between twelve and one oclock the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at fiveon mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servantgirl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coalscuttles and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a fourmiles walk arrived at heathcliffs gardengate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.  on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb. being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberrybushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.  wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. at least i would not keep my doors barred in the daytime. i dont carei will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently. vinegarfaced joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.  what are ye for he shouted. t maisters down i t fowld. go round by th end o t laith if ye went to spake to him.  is there nobody inside to open the door i hallooed responsively.  theres nobbut t missis and shooll not oppen t an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght.  why cannot you tell her whom i am eh joseph  norne me ill hae no hend wit muttered the head vanishing.  the snow began to drive thickly. i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind. he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a washhouse and a paved area containing a coalshed pump and pigeoncot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received. it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected. i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat. she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute.  rough weather i remarked. im afraid mrs. heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me.  she never opened her mouth. i staredshe stared also at any rate she kept her eyes on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.  sit down said the young man gruffly. hell be in soon.  i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance.  a beautiful animal i commenced again. do you intend parting with the little ones madam  they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied.  ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.  a strange choice of favourites she observed scornfully.  unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits. i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.  you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the chimneypiece two of the painted canisters.  her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance. she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eyes had they been agreeable in expression that would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there. the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.  i dont want your help she snapped i can get them for myself.  i beg your pardon i hastened to reply.  were you asked to tea she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.  i shall be glad to have a cup i answered.  were you asked she repeated.  no i said half smiling. you are the proper person to ask me.  she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red underlip pushed out like a childs ready to cry.  meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eyes for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us. i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr. and mrs. heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a domestics assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state.  you see sir i am come according to promise i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weatherbound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space.  half an hour he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snowstorm to ramble about in. do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.  perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till morningcould you spare me one  no i could not.  oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity.  umph  are you going to mak the tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.  is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff.  get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started. the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature. i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow. when the preparations were finished he invited me withnow sir bring forward your chair. and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.  i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it. they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however illtempered they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their everyday countenance.  it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving anotherit is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr. heathcliff yet ill venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart  my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face. where is shemy amiable lady  mrs. heathcliff your wife i mean.  well yesoh you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone. is that it  perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it. i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife. one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years. the other did not look seventeen.  then it flashed upon methe clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course. here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad pityi must beware how i cause her to regret her choice. the last reflection may seem conceited it was not. my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive.  mrs. heathcliff is my daughterinlaw said heathcliff corroborating my surmise. he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul.  ah certainlyi see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour.  this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault. but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice.  unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead. i said she was my daughterinlaw therefore she must have married my son.  and this young man is  not my son assuredly.  heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.  my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and id counsel you to respect it  ive shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself.  he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible. i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle. the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralised the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time.  the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather. a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.  i dont think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming. the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.  hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. theyll be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff.  how must i do i continued with rising irritation.  there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs. heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimneypiece as she restored the teacanister to its place. the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated outaw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i idleness un war when all on ems goan out bud yahre a nowt and its no use talkingyahll niver mend oyer ill ways but goa raight to t divil like yer mother afore ye  i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door. mrs. heathcliff however checked me by her answer.  you scandalous old hypocrite she replied. are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the devils name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ill ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf ill show you how far ive progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. the red cow didnt die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations  oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil  no reprobate you are a castawaybe off or ill hurt you seriously ill have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix shallill not say what he shall be done tobut youll see go im looking at you  the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went. i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress.  mrs. heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you. i presume because with that face im sure you cannot help being goodhearted. do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london  take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her. it is brief advice but as sound as i can give.  then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience wont whisper that it is partly your fault  how so i cannot escort you. they wouldnt let me go to the end of the garden wall.  you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried. i want you to tell me my way not to show it or else to persuade mr. heathcliff to give me a guide.  who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i. which would you have  are there no boys at the farm  no those are all.  then it follows that i am compelled to stay.  that you may settle with your host. i have nothing to do with it.  i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried heathcliffs stern voice from the kitchen entrance. as to staying here i dont keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do.  i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied.  no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch.  with this insult my patience was at an end. i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste. it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other. at first the young man appeared about to befriend me.  ill go with him as far as the park he said.  youll go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore. and who is to look after the horses eh  a mans life is of more consequence than one evenings neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs. heathcliff more kindly than i expected.  not at your command retorted hareton. if you set store on him youd better be quiet.  then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr. heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply.  hearken hearken shoos cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering.  he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern.  maister maister hes staling t lanthern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat. hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him  on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation. fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me outon their peril to keep me one minute longerwith several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear.  the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded. i dont know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer. this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.  well mr. earnshaw she cried i wonder what youll have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for melook at t poor lad hes fair choking wisht wisht you munnt go on so. come in and ill cure that there now hold ye still.  with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen. mr. heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.  i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed.     chapter iii   while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly. i asked the reason. she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious.  too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed. the whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothespress and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows. having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of oldfashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table.  i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and every one else.  the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and smallcatherine earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and then again to catherine linton.  in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine earnshawheathclifflinton till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectresthe air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candlewick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin.  i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a flyleaf bore the inscriptioncatherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back.  i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all. catherines library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a penandink commentaryat least the appearance of onecovering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand. at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend josephrudely yet powerfully sketched. an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.  an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath. i wish my father were back again. hindley is a detestable substitutehis conduct to heathcliff is atrocioush. and i are going to rebelwe took our initiatory step this evening.  all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable firedoing anything but reading their bibles ill answer for itheathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayerbooks and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.  you forget you have a master here says the tyrant. ill demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence. oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers. frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husbands knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hourfoolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables. he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks  t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath not oered und t sound o t gospel still i yer lugs and ye darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye down ill childer theres good books eneugh if yell read em sit ye down and think o yer sowls  saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the faroff fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us. i could not bear the employment. i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dogkennel vowing i hated a good book. heathcliff kicked his to the same place. then there was a hubbub  maister hindley shouted our chaplain. maister coom hither miss cathys riven th back off th helmet o salvation un heathcliffs pawsed his fit into t first part o t brooad way to destruction its fair flaysome that ye let em go on this gait. ech th owd man wad ha laced em properlybut hes goan  hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the backkitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the housedoor ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywomans cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter. a pleasant suggestionand then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verifiedwe cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here.          i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose.  how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote. my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i cant give over. poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders. he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place          i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print. i saw a red ornamented titleseventy times seven and the first of the seventyfirst. a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabez branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough. and while i was halfconsciously worrying my brain to guess what jabez branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep. alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i dont remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering.  i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality. i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide. the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a pilgrims staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavyheaded cudgel which i understood to be so denominated. for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. then a new idea flashed across me. i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabez branderham preach from the textseventy times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the seventyfirst and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.  we came to the chapel. i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergymans stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. however in my dream jabez had a full and attentive congregation and he preachedgood god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell. he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion. they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously.  oh how weary i grew. how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done. i was condemned to hear all out finally he reached the first of the seventyfirst. at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabez branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon.  sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to departseventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. the four hundred and ninetyfirst is too much. fellowmartyrs have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more  thou art the man cried jabez after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion. seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visageseventy times seven did i take counsel with my soullo this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the seventyfirst is come. brethren execute upon him the judgment written. such honour have all his saints  with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrims staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in selfdefence commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his. in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces. presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings every mans hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me. and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played jabezs part in the row merely the branch of a firtree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before.  this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved to silence it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten. i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little icecold hand  the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed  let me inlet me in  who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself.  catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for lintonim come home id lost my way on the moor  as it spoke i discerned obscurely a childs face looking through the window. terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious gripe almost maddening me with fear.  how can i i said at length. let me go if you want me to let you in  the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on  begone i shouted. ill never let you in not if you beg for twenty years.  it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years. ive been a waif for twenty years  thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.  i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright.  to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself.  at last he said in a halfwhisper plainly not expecting an answer  is any one here  i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew heathcliffs accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet.  with this intention i turned and opened the panels. i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.  heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him. the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up.  it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare. im sorry i disturbed you.  oh god confound you mr. lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady. and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. who was it ive a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment  it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments. i should not care if you did mr. heathcliff she richly deserves it. i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense. well it isswarming with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you. no one will thank you for a doze in such a den  what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heavens sake dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut  if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned. im not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again. was not the reverend jabez branderham akin to you on the mothers side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was calledshe must have been a changelingwicked little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions ive no doubt  scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of heathcliffs with catherines name in the book which had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened. i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to addthe truth is sir i passed the first part of the night in here i stopped afreshi was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went onin spelling over the name scratched on that windowledge. a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or  what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence. howhow dare you under my roofgod hes mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage.  i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control. heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looked at my watch and soliloquised on the length of the night not three oclock yet i could have taken oath it had been six. time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight  always at nine in winter and rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arms shadow dashing a tear from his eyes. mr. lockwood he added you may go into my room youll only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.  and for me too i replied. ill walk in the yard till daylight and then ill be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town. a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.  delightful company muttered heathcliff. take the candle and go where you please. i shall join you directly. keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the housejuno mounts sentinel there andnay you can only ramble about the steps and passages. but away with you ill come in two minutes  i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears. come in come in he sobbed. cathy do come. oh doonce more oh my hearts darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a spectres ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light.  there was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension. i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the backkitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle. nothing was stirring except a brindled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew.  two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other. we were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose. he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a threeinch pipe with tobacco. my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away. i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came.  a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a goodmorning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orison sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him. he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality.  it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs. heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze. she held her hand interposed between the furnaceheat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. i was surprised to see heathcliff there also. he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene with poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan.  and you you worthless he broke out as i entered turning to his daughterinlaw and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash. there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their breadyou live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do. you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sightdo you hear damnable jade  ill put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair. but ill not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please  heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight. having no desire to be entertained by a catanddog combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fists out of temptation in his pockets mrs. heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay. that was not long. i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice.  my landlord halloed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor. it was well he did for the whole hillback was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterdays walk left pictured in my mind. i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road.  we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there. our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porters lodge is untenanted as yet. the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights.  my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.     chapter iv   what vain weathercocks we are i who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse and thanked my stars that at length i had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticablei weak wretch after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude was finally compelled to strike my colours and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment i desired mrs. dean when she brought in supper to sit down while i ate it hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.  you have lived here a considerable time i commenced did you not say sixteen years  eighteen sir i came when the mistress was married to wait on her after she died the master retained me for his housekeeper.  indeed.  there ensued a pause. she was not a gossip i feared unless about her own affairs and those could hardly interest me. however having studied for an interval with a fist on either knee and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance she ejaculatedah times are greatly changed since then  yes i remarked youve seen a good many alterations i suppose  i have and troubles too she said.  oh ill turn the talk on my landlords family i thought to myself. a good subject to start and that pretty girlwidow i should like to know her history whether she be a native of the country or as is more probable an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognise for kin. with this intention i asked mrs. dean why heathcliff let thrushcross grange and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior. is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order i inquired.  rich sir she returned. he has nobody knows what money and every year it increases. yes yes hes rich enough to live in a finer house than this but hes very nearclosehanded and if he had meant to flit to thrushcross grange as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more. it is strange people should be so greedy when they are alone in the world  he had a son it seems  yes he had onehe is dead.  and that young lady mrs. heathcliff is his widow  yes.  where did she come from originally  why sir she is my late masters daughter catherine linton was her maiden name. i nursed her poor thing i did wish mr. heathcliff would remove here and then we might have been together again.  what catherine linton i exclaimed astonished. but a minutes reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine. then i continued my predecessors name was linton  it was.  and who is that earnshaw hareton earnshaw who lives with mr. heathcliff are they relations  no he is the late mrs. lintons nephew.  the young ladys cousin then  yes and her husband was her cousin also one on the mothers the other on the fathers side heathcliff married mr. lintons sister.  i see the house at wuthering heights has earnshaw carved over the front door. are they an old family  very old sir and hareton is the last of them as our miss cathy is of usi mean of the lintons. have you been to wuthering heights i beg pardon for asking but i should like to hear how she is  mrs. heathcliff she looked very well and very handsome yet i think not very happy.  oh dear i dont wonder and how did you like the master  a rough fellow rather mrs. dean. is not that his character  rough as a sawedge and hard as whinstone the less you meddle with him the better.  he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl. do you know anything of his history  its a cuckoos siri know all about it except where he was born and who were his parents and how he got his money at first. and hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.  well mrs. dean it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.  oh certainly sir ill just fetch a little sewing and then ill sit as long as you please. but youve caught cold i saw you shivering and you must have some gruel to drive it out.  the worthy woman bustled off and i crouched nearer the fire my head felt hot and the rest of me chill moreover i was excited almost to a pitch of foolishness through my nerves and brain. this caused me to feel not uncomfortable but rather fearful as i am still of serious effects from the incidents of today and yesterday. she returned presently bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work and having placed the former on the hob drew in her seat evidently pleased to find me so companionable.         before i came to live here she commencedwaiting no farther invitation to her storyi was almost always at wuthering heights because my mother had nursed mr. hindley earnshaw that was haretons father and i got used to playing with the children i ran errands too and helped to make hay and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to. one fine summer morningit was the beginning of harvest i remembermr. earnshaw the old master came downstairs dressed for a journey and after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day he turned to hindley and cathy and mefor i sat eating my porridge with themand he said speaking to his son now my bonny man im going to liverpool today what shall i bring you you may choose what you like only let it be little for i shall walk there and back sixty miles each way that is a long spell hindley named a fiddle and then he asked miss cathy she was hardly six years old but she could ride any horse in the stable and she chose a whip. he did not forget me for he had a kind heart though he was rather severe sometimes. he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears and then he kissed his children said goodbye and set off.  it seemed a long while to us allthe three days of his absenceand often did little cathy ask when he would be home. mrs. earnshaw expected him by suppertime on the third evening and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no signs of his coming however and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up and just about eleven oclock the doorlatch was raised quietly and in stepped the master. he threw himself into a chair laughing and groaning and bid them all stand off for he was nearly killedhe would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.  and at the end of it to be flighted to death he said opening his greatcoat which he held bundled up in his arms. see here wife i was never so beaten with anything in my life but you must een take it as a gift of god though its as dark almost as if it came from the devil.  we crowded round and over miss cathys head i had a peep at a dirty ragged blackhaired child big enough both to walk and talk indeed its face looked older than catherines yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand. i was frightened and mrs. earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors she did fly up asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tried to explain the matter but he was really half dead with fatigue and all that i could make out amongst her scolding was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless and as good as dumb in the streets of liverpool where he picked it up and inquired for its owner. not a soul knew to whom it belonged he said and his money and time being both limited he thought it better to take it home with him at once than run into vain expenses there because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it. well the conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm and mr. earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean things and let it sleep with the children.  hindley and cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored then both began searching their fathers pockets for the presents he had promised them. the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed to morsels in the greatcoat he blubbered aloud and cathy when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners. they entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sense so i put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow. by chance or else attracted by hearing his voice it crept to mr. earnshaws door and there he found it on quitting his chamber. inquiries were made as to how it got there i was obliged to confess and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.  this was heathcliffs first introduction to the family. on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname. miss cathy and he were now very thick but hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i wasnt reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.  he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to illtreatment he would stand hindleys blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame. this endurance made old earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him. he took to heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.  so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs. earnshaws death which happened in less than two years after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurper of his parents affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. i sympathised a while but when the children fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my idea. heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadnt wit to guess that i was compelled to do it. however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over. the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial. cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble.  he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care. i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus hindley lost his last ally still i couldnt dote on heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude. he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes. as an instance i remember mr. earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one. heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to hindley  you must exchange horses with me i dont like mine and if you wont i shall tell your father of the three thrashings youve given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder. hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears. youd better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows youll get them again with interest. off dog cried hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. throw it he replied standing still and then ill tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly. hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it. take my colt gipsy then said young earnshaw. and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of satan.and take that i hope hell kick out your brains  heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could. i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house. i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted. he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear.     chapter v   in the course of time mr. earnshaw began to fail. he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimneycorner he grew grievously irritable. a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. this was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an illturn. it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the childs pride and black tempers. still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice hindleys manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it.  at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr. earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he saidhindley was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered.  i hoped heartily we should have peace now. it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame. we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two peoplemiss cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i daresay up yonder. he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest selfrighteous pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. by his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr. earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained. he was relentless in worrying him about his souls concerns and about ruling his children rigidly. he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine always minding to flatter earnshaws weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.  certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a minutes security that she wouldnt be in mischief. her spirits were always at highwater mark her tongue always goingsinging laughing and plaguing everybody who would not do the same. a wild wicked slip she wasbut she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believe she meant no harm for when once she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happened that she would not keep you company and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. she was much too fond of heathcliff. the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him yet she got chided more than any of us on his account. in play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress using her hands freely and commanding her companions she did so to me but i would not bear slapping and ordering and so i let her know.  now mr. earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children he had always been strict and grave with them and catherine on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime. his peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once and she defying us with her bold saucy look and her ready words turning josephs religious curses into ridicule baiting me and doing just what her father hated mostshowing how her pretended insolence which he thought real had more power over heathcliff than his kindness how the boy would do her bidding in anything and his only when it suited his own inclination. after behaving as badly as possible all day she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night. nay cathy the old man would say i cannot love thee thourt worse than thy brother. go say thy prayers child and ask gods pardon. i doubt thy mother and i must rue that we ever reared thee that made her cry at first and then being repulsed continually hardened her and she laughed if i told her to say she was sorry for her faults and beg to be forgiven.  but the hour came at last that ended mr. earnshaws troubles on earth. he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fireside. a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all togetheri a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done. miss cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her fathers knee and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hairit pleased him rarely to see her gentleand saying why canst thou not always be a good lass cathy and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep. she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast. then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him. we all kept as mute as mice a full halfhour and should have done so longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed. he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him. i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the children each by an arm whispered them to frame upstairs and make little dinthey might pray alone that eveninghe had summut to do.  i shall bid father goodnight first said catherine putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her. the poor thing discovered her loss directlyshe screamed outoh hes dead heathcliff hes dead and they both set up a heartbreaking cry.  i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. i could not guess the use that either would be of then. however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning. leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the childrens room their door was ajar i saw they had never lain down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them. the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together.     chapter vi   mr. hindley came home to the funeral anda thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and lefthe brought a wife with him. what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father.  she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account. every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners. i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the children and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands and asking repeatedlyare they gone yet then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell aweepingand when i asked what was the matter answered she didnt know but she felt so afraid of dying i imagined her as little likely to die as myself. she was rather thin but young and freshcomplexioned and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. i did remark to be sure that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathise with her. we dont in general take to foreigners here mr. lockwood unless they take to us first.  young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence. he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the backkitchen and leave the house for him. indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delfcase and dogkennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention.  she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning. her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish hindley became tyrannical. a few words from her evincing a dislike to heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy. he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm.  heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields. they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him. he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging and catherine a fast from dinner or supper. but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at. the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time ive cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures. one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the sittingroom for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere. we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors and swore nobody should let them in that night. the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return. in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate. i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr. earnshaw by knocking. there was heathcliff by himself it gave me a start to see him alone.  where is miss catherine i cried hurriedly. no accident i hope at thrushcross grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay. well you will catch it i said youll never be content till youre sent about your business. what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange let me get off my wet clothes and ill tell you all about it nelly he replied. i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he continuedcathy and i escaped from the washhouse to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange lights we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eyes out before the fire. do you think they do or reading sermons and being catechised by their manservant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they dont answer properly probably not i responded. they are good children no doubt and dont deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct. dont cant nelly he said nonsense we ran from the top of the heights to the park without stoppingcatherine completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot. youll have to seek for her shoes in the bog tomorrow. we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flowerplot under the drawingroom window. the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed. both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we sawah it was beautifula splendid place carpeted with crimson and crimsoncovered chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glassdrops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers. old mr. and mrs. linton were not there edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves. shouldnt they have been happy we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good children were doing isabellai believe she is eleven a year younger than cathylay screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running redhot needles into her. edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. the idiots that was their pleasure to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it. we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room id not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for edgar lintons at thrushcross grangenot if i might have the privilege of flinging joseph off the highest gable and painting the housefront with hindleys blood  hush hush i interrupted. still you have not told me heathcliff how catherine is left behind  i told you we laughed he answered. the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma oh papa oh mamma come here. oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way. we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee. i had cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down. run heathcliff run she whispered. they have let the bulldog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle nelly i heard his abominable snorting. she did not yell outno she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a stone and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last shoutingkeep fast skulker keep fast he changed his note however when he saw skulkers game. the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. the man took cathy up she was sick not from fear im certain but from pain. he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance. what prey robert hallooed linton from the entrance. skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and theres a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an outandouter very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease. hold your tongue you foulmouthed thief you you shall go to the gallows for this. mr. linton sir dont lay by your gun. no no robert said the old fool. the rascals knew that yesterday was my rentday they thought to have me cleverly. come in ill furnish them a reception. there john fasten the chain. give skulker some water jenny. to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here dont be afraid it is but a boyyet the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs. linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. the cowardly children crept nearer also isabella lispingfrightful thing put him in the cellar papa. hes exactly like the son of the fortuneteller that stole my tame pheasant. isnt he edgar  while they examined me cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed. edgar linton after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognise her. they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere. thats miss earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten herhow her foot bleeds  miss earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in mourningsurely it isand she may be lamed for life  what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr. linton turning from me to catherine. ive understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism. but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to liverpoola little lascar or an american or spanish castaway.  a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton im shocked that my children should have heard it.  i recommenced cursingdont be angry nellyand so robert was ordered to take me off. i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr. earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again. the curtains were still looped up at one corner and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out. she sat on the sofa quietly. mrs. linton took off the grey cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine. then the womanservant brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr. linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance. afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the lintonsa dim reflection from her own enchanting face. i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to themto everybody on earth is she not nelly  there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light. you are incurable heathcliff and mr. hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he wont. my words came truer than i desired. the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious. and then mr. linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest. heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs. earnshaw undertook to keep her sisterinlaw in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible.     chapter vii   cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks till christmas. by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved. the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her selfrespect with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in. hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why cathy you are quite a beauty i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now. isabella linton is not to be compared with her is she frances isabella has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here. ellen help miss catherine off with her thingsstay dear you will disarrange your curlslet me untie your hat.  i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments. she kissed me gently i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for heathcliff. mr. and mrs. earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.  heathcliff was hard to discover at first. if he were careless and uncared for before catherines absence he had been ten times more so since. nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water. therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded. he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a roughheaded counterpart of himself as he expected. is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.  heathcliff you may come forward cried mr. hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself. you may come and wish miss catherine welcome like the other servants.  cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross you look and howhow funny and grim but thats because im used to edgar and isabella linton. well heathcliff have you forgotten me  she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable.  shake hands heathcliff said mr. earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted.  i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at. i shall not bear it  and he would have broken from the circle but miss cathy seized him again.  i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself heathcliff shake hands at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd. if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty  she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his.  you neednt have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand. i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty.  with that he dashed headforemost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper.  after playing ladysmaid to the newcomer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmaseve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of josephs affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs. he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr. and mrs. earnshaw were engaging missys attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness. they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs. linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy.  under these circumstances i remained solitary. i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular carethe scoured and wellswept floor. i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmasbox and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor lads situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying. it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him. he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom.  make haste heathcliff i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is upstairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime.  he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me.  comeare you coming i continued. theres a little cake for each of you nearly enough and youll need halfanhours donning.  i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him. catherine supped with her brother and sisterinlaw joseph and i joined at an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other. his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. he managed to continue work till nine oclock and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back. in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his illhumour on to the moors not reappearing till the family were departed for church. fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit. he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptlynelly make me decent im going to be good.  high time heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine shes sorry she ever came home i daresay it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you.  the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.  did she say she was grieved he inquired looking very serious.  she cried when i told her you were off again this morning.  well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she.  yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i. proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in. you must go up and offer to kiss her and sayyou know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. and now though i have dinner to get ready ill steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does. you are younger and yet ill be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling dont you feel that you could  heathcliffs face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed.  but nelly if i knocked him down twenty times that wouldnt make him less handsome or me more so. i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be  and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain. oh heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit come to the glass and ill let you see what you should wish. do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their windows boldly but lurk glinting under them like devils spies wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. dont get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers.  in other words i must wish for edgar lintons great blue eyes and even forehead he replied. i doand that wont help me to them.  a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly. and now that weve done washing and combing and sulkingtell me whether you dont think yourself rather handsome ill tell you i do. youre fit for a prince in disguise. who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one weeks income wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england. were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer  so i chattered on and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter. catherine took a hand of each of the children and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces.  i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side hindley opened it on the other. they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs. linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the roomsend him into the garret till dinner is over. hell be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute.  nay sir i could not avoid answering hell touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.  he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs till dark cried hindley. begone you vagabond what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant lockssee if i wont pull them a bit longer  they are long enough already observed master linton peeping from the doorway i wonder they dont make his head ache. its like a colts mane over his eyes  he ventured this remark without any intention to insult but heathcliffs violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival. he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his gripe and dashed it full against the speakers face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place. mr. earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he appeared red and breathless. i got the dishcloth and rather spitefully scrubbed edgars nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling. his sister began weeping to go home and cathy stood by confounded blushing for all.  you should not have spoken to him she expostulated with master linton. he was in a bad temper and now youve spoilt your visit and hell be flogged i hate him to be flogged i cant eat my dinner. why did you speak to him edgar  i didnt sobbed the youth escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pockethandkerchief. i promised mamma that i wouldnt say one word to him and i didnt.  well dont cry replied catherine contemptuously youre not killed. dont make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet hush isabella has anybody hurt you  there there childrento your seats cried hindley bustling in. that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. next time master edgar take the law into your own fistsit will give you an appetite  the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast. they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them. mr. earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine with dry eyes and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her. an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old playmates troubles. i could not have imagined her to be so selfish. she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them. she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion. i did not call her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to heathcliff who had been locked up by the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals.  in the evening we had a dance. cathy begged that he might be liberated then as isabella linton had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency. we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoons french horns and a bass viol besides singers. they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a firstrate treat to hear them. after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees. mrs. earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty.  catherine loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark i followed. they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full of people. she made no stay at the stairshead but mounted farther to the garret where heathcliff was confined and called him. he stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards. i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her. instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within. the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again. when she did come heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my fellowservant had gone to a neighbours to be removed from the sound of our devils psalmody as it pleased him to call it. i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterdays dinner i would wink at his cheating mr. hindley that once. he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation. on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravelyim trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back. i dont care how long i wait if i can only do it at last. i hope he will not die before i do  for shame heathcliff said i. it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive.  no god wont have the satisfaction that i shall he returned. i only wish i knew the best way let me alone and ill plan it out while im thinking of that i dont feel pain.  but mr. lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you. im annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed i could have told heathcliffs history all that you need hear in half a dozen words.         thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose and proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding. sit still mrs. dean i cried do sit still another halfhour. youve done just right to tell the story leisurely. that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style. i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less.  the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir.  no matterim not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.  you shouldnt lie till ten. theres the very prime of the morning gone long before that time. a person who has not done onehalf his days work by ten oclock runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.  nevertheless mrs. dean resume your chair because tomorrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon. i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least.  i hope not sir. well you must allow me to leap over some three years during that space mrs. earnshaw  no no ill allow nothing of the sort are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that pusss neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper  a terribly lazy mood i should say.  on the contrary a tiresomely active one. it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely. i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the lookeron. they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things. i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a years standing. one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.  oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us observed mrs. dean somewhat puzzled at my speech.  excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion. excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class. i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think. you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.  mrs. dean laughed.  i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from years end to years end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr. lockwood. you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor mans daughter. however if i am to follow my story in true gossips fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three years i will be content to pass to the next summerthe summer of  that is nearly twentythree years ago.     chapter viii   on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born. we were busy with the hay in a faraway field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran.  oh such a grand bairn she panted out. the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says shes been in a consumption these many months. i heard him tell mr. hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and shell be dead before winter. you must come home directly. youre to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night. i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis  but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet.  i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. shes out of her head for joy its such a beauty if i were her im certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth. i was fairly mad at him. dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up when the old croaker steps forward and says heearnshaw its a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son. when she came i felt convinced we shouldnt keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her. dont take on and fret about it too much it cant be helped. and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass  and what did the master answer i inquired.  i think he swore but i didnt mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously. i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for hindleys sake. he had room in his heart only for two idolshis wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i couldnt conceive how he would bear the loss.  when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby  nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile.  and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says shes  damn the doctor he interrupted reddening. frances is quite right shell be perfectly well by this time next week. are you going upstairs will you tell her that ill come if shell promise not to talk. i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she musttell her mr. kenneth says she must be quiet.  i delivered this message to mrs. earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily i hardly spoke a word ellen and there he has gone out twice crying. well say i promise i wont speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him  poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day. when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he neednt put him to further expense by attending her he retorted i know you need notshes wellshe does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption. it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool.  he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took hera very slight onehe raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead.  as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands. mr. earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him. for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay. i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his fostersister and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would. joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.  the masters bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff. his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint. and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period. he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. i could not half tell what an infernal house we had. the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar lintons visits to miss cathy might be an exception. at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though. she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression. he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace. it used to hang on one side and his wifes on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was. can you make that out  mrs. dean raised the candle and i discerned a softfeatured face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression. it formed a sweet picture. the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful. i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual. i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw.  a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper. is it like  yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general.  catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her fiveweeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the firstfor she was full of ambitionand led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one. in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.  mr. edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly. he had a terror of earnshaws reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way. i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her. ive had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. that sounds illnatured but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility. she did bring herself finally to confess and to confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.  mr. hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of. in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning. his childhoods sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr. earnshaw was faded away. he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level. then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.  catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him. on the beforenamed occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr. edgar of her brothers absence and was then preparing to receive him.  cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff. are you going anywhere  no it is raining she answered.  why have you that silk frock on then he said. nobody coming here i hope  not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff. it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone.  hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy. ill not work any more today ill stay with you.  oh but joseph will tell she suggested youd better go  joseph is loading lime on the further side of penistone crags it will take him till dark and hell never know.  so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down. catherine reflected an instant with knitted browsshe found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion. isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a minutes silence. as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good.  order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted dont turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours im on the point sometimes of complaining that theybut ill not  that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance. oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands youve combed my hair quite out of curl thats enough let me alone. what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff  nothingonly look at the almanack on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and continued the crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me. do you see ive marked every day.  yesvery foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone. and where is the sense of that  to show that i do take notice said heathcliff.  and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated. what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either  you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation.  its no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered.  her companion rose up but he hadnt time to express his feelings further for a horses feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received. doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out. the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect. he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do thats less gruff than we talk here and softer.  im not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.  no answered catherine. what are you doing there nelly  my work miss i replied. mr. hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits linton chose to pay.  she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants dont commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are  its a good opportunity now that master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. im sure mr. edgar will excuse me.  i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff.  im sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation.  she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm. ive said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss thats a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and im not going to bear it.  i didnt touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage. she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.  whats that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her.  she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.  catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.  leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over.  little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him. in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest. he drew back in consternation. i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip.  thats right i said to myself. take warning and begone its a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.  where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door.  he swerved aside and attempted to pass.  you must not go she exclaimed energetically.  i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice.  no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper. i should be miserable all night and i wont be miserable for you  can i stay after you have struck me asked linton.  catherine was mute.  youve made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued ill not come here again  her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.  and you told a deliberate untruth he said.  i didnt she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately. well go if you pleaseget away and now ill cryill cry myself sick  she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest. edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered. i resolved to encourage him.  miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out. as bad as any marred child youd better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us.  the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten. ah i thought there will be no saving him hes doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacyhad broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers.  intelligence of mr. hindleys arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber. i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the masters fowlingpiece which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.     chapter ix   he entered vociferating oaths dreadful to hear and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beasts fondness or his madmans rage for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death and in the other of being flung into the fire or dashed against the wall and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever i chose to put him.  there ive found it out at last cried hindley pulling me back by the skin of my neck like a dog. by heaven and hell youve sworn between you to murder that child i know how it is now that he is always out of my way. but with the help of satan i shall make you swallow the carvingknife nelly you neednt laugh for ive just crammed kenneth headdownmost in the blackhorse marsh and two is the same as oneand i want to kill some of you i shall have no rest till i do  but i dont like the carvingknife mr. hindley i answered it has been cutting red herrings. id rather be shot if you please.  youd rather be damned he said and so you shall. no law in england can hinder a man from keeping his house decent and mines abominable open your mouth.  he held the knife in his hand and pushed its point between my teeth but for my part i was never much afraid of his vagaries. i spat out and affirmed it tasted detestablyi would not take it on any account.  oh said he releasing me i see that hideous little villain is not hareton i beg your pardon nell. if it be he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me and for screaming as if i were a goblin. unnatural cub come hither ill teach thee to impose on a goodhearted deluded father. now dont you think the lad would be handsomer cropped it makes a dog fiercer and i love something fierceget me a scissorssomething fierce and trim besides its infernal affectationdevilish conceit it is to cherish our earswere asses enough without them. hush child hush well then it is my darling wisht dry thy eyestheres a joy kiss me. what it wont kiss me hareton damn thee kiss me by god as if i would rear such a monster as sure as im living ill break the brats neck.  poor hareton was squalling and kicking in his fathers arms with all his might and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the banister. i cried out that he would frighten the child into fits and ran to rescue him. as i reached them hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below almost forgetting what he had in his hands. who is that he asked hearing some one approaching the stairsfoot. i leant forward also for the purpose of signing to heathcliff whose step i recognised not to come further and at the instant when my eye quitted hareton he gave a sudden spring delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him and fell.  there was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe. heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment by a natural impulse he arrested his descent and setting him on his feet looked up to discover the author of the accident. a miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of mr. earnshaw above. it expressed plainer than words could do the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge. had it been dark i daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing haretons skull on the steps but we witnessed his salvation and i was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart. hindley descended more leisurely sobered and abashed.  it is your fault ellen he said you should have kept him out of sight you should have taken him from me is he injured anywhere  injured i cried angrily if he is not killed hell be an idiot oh i wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him. youre worse than a heathentreating your own flesh and blood in that manner  he attempted to touch the child who on finding himself with me sobbed off his terror directly. at the first finger his father laid on him however he shrieked again louder than before and struggled as if he would go into convulsions.  you shall not meddle with him i continued. he hates youthey all hate youthats the truth a happy family you have and a pretty state youre come to  i shall come to a prettier yet nelly laughed the misguided man recovering his hardness. at present convey yourself and him away. and hark you heathcliff clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. i wouldnt murder you tonight unless perhaps i set the house on fire but thats as my fancy goes.  while saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser and poured some into a tumbler.  nay dont i entreated. mr. hindley do take warning. have mercy on this unfortunate boy if you care nothing for yourself  any one will do better for him than i shall he answered.  have mercy on your own soul i said endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.  not i on the contrary i shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its maker exclaimed the blasphemer. heres to its hearty damnation  he drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.  its a pity he cannot kill himself with drink observed heathcliff muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. hes doing his very utmost but his constitution defies him. mr. kenneth says he would wager his mare that hell outlive any man on this side gimmerton and go to the grave a hoary sinner unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.  i went into the kitchen and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep. heathcliff as i thought walked through to the barn. it turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle when he flung himself on a bench by the wall removed from the fire and remained silent.  i was rocking hareton on my knee and humming a song that began  it was far in the night and the bairnies grat the mither beneath the mools heard that   when miss cathy who had listened to the hubbub from her room put her head in and whisperedare you alone nelly  yes miss i replied.  she entered and approached the hearth. i supposing she was going to say something looked up. the expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious. her lips were half asunder as if she meant to speak and she drew a breath but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. i resumed my song not having forgotten her recent behaviour.  wheres heathcliff she said interrupting me.  about his work in the stable was my answer.  he did not contradict me perhaps he had fallen into a doze. there followed another long pause during which i perceived a drop or two trickle from catherines cheek to the flags. is she sorry for her shameful conducti asked myself. that will be a novelty but she may come to the point as she willi shant help her no she felt small trouble regarding any subject save her own concerns.  oh dear she cried at last. im very unhappy  a pity observed i. youre hard to please so many friends and so few cares and cant make yourself content  nelly will you keep a secret for me she pursued kneeling down by me and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it.  is it worth keeping i inquired less sulkily.  yes and it worries me and i must let it out i want to know what i should do. today edgar linton has asked me to marry him and ive given him an answer. now before i tell you whether it was a consent or denial you tell me which it ought to have been.  really miss catherine how can i know i replied. to be sure considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon i might say it would be wise to refuse him since he asked you after that he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.  if you talk so i wont tell you any more she returned peevishly rising to her feet. i accepted him nelly. be quick and say whether i was wrong  you accepted him then what good is it discussing the matter you have pledged your word and cannot retract.  but say whether i should have done sodo she exclaimed in an irritated tone chafing her hands together and frowning.  there are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly i said sententiously. first and foremost do you love mr. edgar  who can help it of course i do she answered.  then i put her through the following catechism for a girl of twentytwo it was not injudicious.  why do you love him miss cathy  nonsense i dothats sufficient.  by no means you must say why  well because he is handsome and pleasant to be with.  bad was my commentary.  and because he is young and cheerful.  bad still.  and because he loves me.  indifferent coming there.  and he will be rich and i shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood and i shall be proud of having such a husband.  worst of all. and now say how you love him  as everybody lovesyoure silly nelly.  not at allanswer.  i love the ground under his feet and the air over his head and everything he touches and every word he says. i love all his looks and all his actions and him entirely and altogether. there now  and why  nay you are making a jest of it it is exceedingly illnatured its no jest to me said the young lady scowling and turning her face to the fire.  im very far from jesting miss catherine i replied. you love mr. edgar because he is handsome and young and cheerful and rich and loves you. the last however goes for nothing you would love him without that probably and with it you wouldnt unless he possessed the four former attractions.  no to be sure not i should only pity himhate him perhaps if he were ugly and a clown.  but there are several other handsome rich young men in the world handsomer possibly and richer than he is. what should hinder you from loving them  if there be any they are out of my way ive seen none like edgar.  you may see some and he wont always be handsome and young and may not always be rich.  he is now and i have only to do with the present. i wish you would speak rationally.  well that settles it if you have only to do with the present marry mr. linton.  i dont want your permission for thati shall marry him and yet you have not told me whether im right.  perfectly right if people be right to marry only for the present. and now let us hear what you are unhappy about. your brother will be pleased the old lady and gentleman will not object i think you will escape from a disorderly comfortless home into a wealthy respectable one and you love edgar and edgar loves you. all seems smooth and easy where is the obstacle  here and here replied catherine striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast in whichever place the soul lives. in my soul and in my heart im convinced im wrong  thats very strange i cannot make it out.  its my secret. but if you will not mock at me ill explain it i cant do it distinctly but ill give you a feeling of how i feel.  she seated herself by me again her countenance grew sadder and graver and her clasped hands trembled.  nelly do you never dream queer dreams she said suddenly after some minutes reflection.  yes now and then i answered.  and so do i. ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the colour of my mind. and this is one im going to tell itbut take care not to smile at any part of it.  oh dont miss catherine i cried. were dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. come come be merry and like yourself look at little hareton hes dreaming nothing dreary. how sweetly he smiles in his sleep  yes and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude you remember him i daresay when he was just such another as that chubby thing nearly as young and innocent. however nelly i shall oblige you to listen its not long and ive no power to be merry tonight.  i wont hear it i wont hear it i repeated hastily.  i was superstitious about dreams then and am still and catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect that made me dread something from which i might shape a prophecy and foresee a fearful catastrophe. she was vexed but she did not proceed. apparently taking up another subject she recommenced in a short time.  if i were in heaven nelly i should be extremely miserable.  because you are not fit to go there i answered. all sinners would be miserable in heaven.  but it is not for that. i dreamt once that i was there.  i tell you i wont hearken to your dreams miss catherine ill go to bed i interrupted again.  she laughed and held me down for i made a motion to leave my chair.  this is nothing cried she i was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home and i broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of wuthering heights where i woke sobbing for joy. that will do to explain my secret as well as the other. ive no more business to marry edgar linton than i have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there had not brought heathcliff so low i shouldnt have thought of it. it would degrade me to marry heathcliff now so he shall never know how i love him and that not because hes handsome nelly but because hes more myself than i am. whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same and lintons is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire.  ere this speech ended i became sensible of heathcliffs presence. having noticed a slight movement i turned my head and saw him rise from the bench and steal out noiselessly. he had listened till he heard catherine say it would degrade her to marry him and then he stayed to hear no further. my companion sitting on the ground was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure but i started and bade her hush  why she asked gazing nervously round.  joseph is here i answered catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road and heathcliff will come in with him. im not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.  oh he couldnt overhear me at the door said she. give me hareton while you get the supper and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. i want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience and be convinced that heathcliff has no notion of these things. he has not has he he does not know what being in love is  i see no reason that he should not know as well as you i returned and if you are his choice hell be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born as soon as you become mrs. linton he loses friend and love and all have you considered how youll bear the separation and how hell bear to be quite deserted in the world because miss catherine  he quite deserted we separated she exclaimed with an accent of indignation. who is to separate us pray theyll meet the fate of milo not as long as i live ellen for no mortal creature. every linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before i could consent to forsake heathcliff. oh thats not what i intendthats not what i mean i shouldnt be mrs. linton were such a price demanded hell be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. edgar must shake off his antipathy and tolerate him at least. he will when he learns my true feelings towards him. nelly i see now you think me a selfish wretch but did it never strike you that if heathcliff and i married we should be beggars whereas if i marry linton i can aid heathcliff to rise and place him out of my brothers power.  with your husbands money miss catherine i asked. youll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon and though im hardly a judge i think thats the worst motive youve given yet for being the wife of young linton.  it is not retorted she it is the best the others were the satisfaction of my whims and for edgars sake too to satisfy him. this is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to edgar and myself. i cannot express it but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. what were the use of my creation if i were entirely contained here my great miseries in this world have been heathcliffs miseries and i watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself. if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger i should not seem a part of it. my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods time will change it im well aware as winter changes the trees. my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary. nelly i am heathcliff hes always always in my mind not as a pleasure any more than i am always a pleasure to myself but as my own being. so dont talk of our separation again it is impracticable and  she paused and hid her face in the folds of my gown but i jerked it forcibly away. i was out of patience with her folly  if i can make any sense of your nonsense miss i said it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying or else that you are a wicked unprincipled girl. but trouble me with no more secrets ill not promise to keep them.  youll keep that she asked eagerly.  no ill not promise i repeated.  she was about to insist when the entrance of joseph finished our conversation and catherine removed her seat to a corner and nursed hareton while i made the supper. after it was cooked my fellowservant and i began to quarrel who should carry some to mr. hindley and we didnt settle it till all was nearly cold. then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask if he wanted any for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.  and how isnt that nowt comed in fro th field be this time what is he about girt idle seeght demanded the old man looking round for heathcliff.  ill call him i replied. hes in the barn ive no doubt.  i went and called but got no answer. on returning i whispered to catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said i was sure and told how i saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brothers conduct regarding him. she jumped up in a fine fright flung hareton on to the settle and ran to seek for her friend herself not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried or how her talk would have affected him. she was absent such a while that joseph proposed we should wait no longer. he cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. they were ill eneugh for ony fahl manners he affirmed. and on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarterofanhours supplication before meat and would have tacked another to the end of the grace had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road and wherever heathcliff had rambled find and make him reenter directly  i want to speak to him and i must before i go upstairs she said. and the gate is open he is somewhere out of hearing for he would not reply though i shouted at the top of the fold as loud as i could.  joseph objected at first she was too much in earnest however to suffer contradiction and at last he placed his hat on his head and walked grumbling forth. meantime catherine paced up and down the floor exclaimingi wonder where he isi wonder where he can be what did i say nelly ive forgotten. was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon dear tell me what ive said to grieve him i do wish hed come. i do wish he would  what a noise for nothing i cried though rather uneasy myself. what a trifle scares you its surely no great cause of alarm that heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hayloft. ill engage hes lurking there. see if i dont ferret him out  i departed to renew my search its result was disappointment and josephs quest ended in the same.  yon lad gets war und war observed he on reentering. hes left th gate at t full swing and misss pony has trodden dahn two rigs o corn and plottered through raight oer into t meadow hahsomdiver t maister ull play t devil tomorn and hell do weel. hes patience itsseln wi sich careless offald craterspatience itsseln he is bud hell not be soa allusyahs see all on ye yah munnt drive him out of his heead for nowt  have you found heathcliff you ass interrupted catherine. have you been looking for him as i ordered  i sud more likker look for th horse he replied. it ud be to more sense. bud i can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike thisas black as t chimbley und heathcliffs noan t chap to coom at my whistlehappen hell be less hard o hearing wi ye  it was a very dark evening for summer the clouds appeared inclined to thunder and i said we had better all sit down the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. however catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. she kept wandering to and fro from the gate to the door in a state of agitation which permitted no repose and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall near the road where heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder and the great drops that began to plash around her she remained calling at intervals and then listening and then crying outright. she beat hareton or any child at a good passionate fit of crying.  about midnight while we still sat up the storm came rattling over the heights in full fury. there was a violent wind as well as thunder and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building a huge bough fell across the roof and knocked down a portion of the east chimneystack sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchenfire. we thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us and joseph swung on to his knees beseeching the lord to remember the patriarchs noah and lot and as in former times spare the righteous though he smote the ungodly. i felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also. the jonah in my mind was mr. earnshaw and i shook the handle of his den that i might ascertain if he were yet living. he replied audibly enough in a fashion which made my companion vociferate more clamorously than before that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. but the uproar passed away in twenty minutes leaving us all unharmed excepting cathy who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. she came in and lay down on the settle all soaked as she was turning her face to the back and putting her hands before it.  well miss i exclaimed touching her shoulder you are not bent on getting your death are you do you know what oclock it is halfpast twelve. come come to bed theres no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy hell be gone to gimmerton and hell stay there now. he guesses we shouldnt wait for him till this late hour at least he guesses that only mr. hindley would be up and hed rather avoid having the door opened by the master.  nay nay hes noan at gimmerton said joseph. is niver wonder but hes at t bothom of a boghoile. this visitation wornt for nowt and i wod hev ye to look out missyah muh be t next. thank hivin for all all warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen and piked out fro th rubbidge yah knaw whet t scripture ses. and he began quoting several texts referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them.  i having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things left him preaching and her shivering and betook myself to bed with little hareton who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him. i heard joseph read on a while afterwards then i distinguished his slow step on the ladder and then i dropped asleep.  coming down somewhat later than usual i saw by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters miss catherine still seated near the fireplace. the housedoor was ajar too light entered from its unclosed windows hindley had come out and stood on the kitchen hearth haggard and drowsy.  what ails you cathy he was saying when i entered you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. why are you so damp and pale child  ive been wet she answered reluctantly and im cold thats all.  oh she is naughty i cried perceiving the master to be tolerably sober. she got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening and there she has sat the night through and i couldnt prevail on her to stir.  mr. earnshaw stared at us in surprise. the night through he repeated. what kept her up not fear of the thunder surely that was over hours since.  neither of us wished to mention heathcliffs absence as long as we could conceal it so i replied i didnt know how she took it into her head to sit up and she said nothing. the morning was fresh and cool i threw back the lattice and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden but catherine called peevishly to me ellen shut the window. im starving and her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers.  shes ill said hindley taking her wrist i suppose thats the reason she would not go to bed. damn it i dont want to be troubled with more sickness here. what took you into the rain  running after t lads as usuald croaked joseph catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. if i war yah maister id just slam t boards i their faces all on em gentle and simple never a day ut yahre off but yon cat o linton comes sneaking hither and miss nelly shoos a fine lass shoo sits watching for ye i t kitchen and as yahre in at one door hes out at tother and then wer grand lady goes acourting of her side its bonny behaviour lurking amang t fields after twelve o t night wi that fahl flaysome divil of a gipsy heathcliff they think im blind but im noan nowt ut t soarti seed young linton boath coming and going and i seed yah directing his discourse to me yah gooid fur nowt slattenly witch nip up and bolt into th house t minute yah heard t maisters horsefit clatter up t road.  silence eavesdropper cried catherine none of your insolence before me edgar linton came yesterday by chance hindley and it was i who told him to be off because i knew you would not like to have met him as you were.  you lie cathy no doubt answered her brother and you are a confounded simpleton but never mind linton at present tell me were you not with heathcliff last night speak the truth now. you need not be afraid of harming him though i hate him as much as ever he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck. to prevent it i shall send him about his business this very morning and after hes gone id advise you all to look sharp i shall only have the more humour for you.  i never saw heathcliff last night answered catherine beginning to sob bitterly and if you do turn him out of doors ill go with him. but perhaps youll never have an opportunity perhaps hes gone. here she burst into uncontrollable grief and the remainder of her words were inarticulate.  hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse and bade her get to her room immediately or she shouldnt cry for nothing i obliged her to obey and i shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber it terrified me. i thought she was going mad and i begged joseph to run for the doctor. it proved the commencement of delirium mr. kenneth as soon as he saw her pronounced her dangerously ill she had a fever. he bled her and he told me to let her live on whey and watergruel and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window and then he left for he had enough to do in the parish where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.  though i cannot say i made a gentle nurse and joseph and the master were no better and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be she weathered it through. old mrs. linton paid us several visits to be sure and set things to rights and scolded and ordered us all and when catherine was convalescent she insisted on conveying her to thrushcross grange for which deliverance we were very grateful. but the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness she and her husband both took the fever and died within a few days of each other.  our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate and haughtier than ever. heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunderstorm and one day i had the misfortune when she had provoked me exceedingly to lay the blame of his disappearance on her where indeed it belonged as she well knew. from that period for several months she ceased to hold any communication with me save in the relation of a mere servant. joseph fell under a ban also he would speak his mind and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl and she esteemed herself a woman and our mistress and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration. then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much she ought to have her own way and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. from mr. earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof and tutored by kenneth and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. he was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices not from affection but from pride he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the lintons and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves for aught he cared edgar linton as multitudes have been before and will be after him was infatuated and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to gimmerton chapel three years subsequent to his fathers death.  much against my inclination i was persuaded to leave wuthering heights and accompany her here. little hareton was nearly five years old and i had just begun to teach him his letters. we made a sad parting but catherines tears were more powerful than ours. when i refused to go and when she found her entreaties did not move me she went lamenting to her husband and brother. the former offered me munificent wages the latter ordered me to pack up he wanted no women in the house he said now that there was no mistress and as to hareton the curate should take him in hand byandby. and so i had but one choice left to do as i was ordered. i told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster i kissed hareton said goodby and since then he has been a stranger and its very queer to think it but ive no doubt he has completely forgotten all about ellen dean and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him         at this point of the housekeepers story she chanced to glance towards the timepiece over the chimney and was in amazement on seeing the minutehand measure halfpast one. she would not hear of staying a second longer in truth i felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself. and now that she is vanished to her rest and i have meditated for another hour or two i shall summon courage to go also in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.     chapter x   a charming introduction to a hermits life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring  mr. heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grousethe last of the season. scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him. but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval. i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting. why not have up mrs. dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone. yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married. ill ring shell be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully. mrs. dean came.  it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced.  away away with it i replied i desire to have  the doctor says you must drop the powders.  with all my heart dont interrupt me. come and take your seat here. keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. draw your knitting out of your pocketthat will donow continue the history of mr. heathcliff from where you left off to the present day. did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a sizars place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his fostercountry or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways  he may have done a little in all these vocations mr. lockwood but i couldnt give my word for any. i stated before that i didnt know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave ill proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you. are you feeling better this morning  much.  thats good news.         i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect. she seemed almost overfond of mr. linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection. they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly. it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be illnatured and badtempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr. edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour. he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed. not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it. catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before. the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him. i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.  it ended. well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the others thoughts. on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering. it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. i set my burden on the housesteps by the kitchendoor and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me saynelly is that you  it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps. something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair. he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. who can it be i thought. mr. earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his.  i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. i dared not enter. you do not know me look im not a stranger  a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deepset and singular. i remembered the eyes.  what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement. what you come back is it really you is it  yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within. are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you neednt be so disturbed. is she here speak i want to have one word with heryour mistress. go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her.  how will she take it i exclaimed. what will she do the surprise bewilders meit will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay theres no comprehending it. have you been for a soldier  go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently. im in hell till you do  he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr. and mrs. linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed. at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door.  they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen. wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side. both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful. i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and mutter a person from gimmerton wishes to see you maam.  what does he want asked mrs. linton.  i did not question him i answered.  well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea. ill be back again directly.  she quitted the apartment mr. edgar inquired carelessly who it was.  some one mistress does not expect i replied. that heathcliffyou recollect him sirwho used to live at mr. earnshaws.  what the gipsythe ploughboy he cried. why did you not say so to catherine  hush you must not call him by those names master i said. shed be sadly grieved to hear you. she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off. i guess his return will make a jubilee to her.  mr. linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court. he unfastened it and leant out. i suppose they were below for he exclaimed quickly dont stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular. ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity.  oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck. oh edgar darling heathcliffs come backhe is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze.  well well cried her husband crossly dont strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. there is no need to be frantic  i know you didnt like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight. yet for my sake you must be friends now. shall i tell him to come up  here he said into the parlour  where else she asked.  he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him. mrs. linton eyed him with a droll expressionhalf angry half laughing at his fastidiousness.  no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen. set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders. will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions. ill run down and secure my guest. im afraid the joy is too great to be real  she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her.  you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd. the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.  i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter. he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. but the ladys glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized lintons reluctant fingers and crushed them into his. now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff. he had grown a tall athletic wellformed man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youthlike. his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army. his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr. lintons it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation. a halfcivilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace. my masters surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him. heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.  sit down sir he said at length. mrs. linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her.  and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part. i shall stay an hour or two willingly.  he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers. they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment. not so mr. edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized heathcliffs hands again and laughed like one beside herself.  i shall think it a dream tomorrow she cried. i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more. and yet cruel heathcliff you dont deserve this welcome. to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me  a little more than you have thought of me he murmured. i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this planjust to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself. your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay youll not drive me off again. you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause. ive fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you  catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness. mr. heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge tonight and im thirsty.  she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room. the meal hardly endured ten minutes. catherines cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink. edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer. i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton  no to wuthering heights he answered mr. earnshaw invited me when i called this morning.  mr. earnshaw invited him and he called on mr. earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone. is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away.  about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs. linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.  i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology. and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because im glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy. he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him.  what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered. as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised its human nature. let mr. linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them.  but does it not show great weakness pursued she. im not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of isabellas yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her. even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper. it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me. but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same.  youre mistaken mrs. linton said i. they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not. you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires. you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.  and then we shall fight to the death shant we nelly she returned laughing. no i tell you i have such faith in lintons love that i believe i might kill him and he wouldnt wish to retaliate.  i advised her to value him the more for his affection.  i do she answered but he neednt resort to whining for trifles. it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of anyones regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy. he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him im sure he behaved excellently  what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired. he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around  he explained it she replied. i wonder as much as you. he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in. there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented. hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he doesnt trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton. he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my brothers covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.  its a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i. have you no fear of the consequences mrs. linton  none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he cant be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm. the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence. oh ive endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter hed be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance. it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as i. however its over and ill take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek id not only turn the other but id ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof ill go make my peace with edgar instantly. goodnight im an angel  in this selfcomplacent conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr. linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by catherines exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.  heathcliffmr. heathcliff i should say in futureused the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected. he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling. my masters uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.  his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest. she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated. her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference. leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a ones power he had sense to comprehend heathcliffs disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged. and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to its keeping. he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on heathcliffs deliberate designing.  we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something. she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience. we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of illhealth she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs. linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor. mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only catherines harshness which made her unhappy.  how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion. you are surely losing your reason. when have i been harsh tell me  yesterday sobbed isabella and now  yesterday said her sisterinlaw. on what occasion  in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr. heathcliff  and thats your notion of harshness said catherine laughing. it was no hint that your company was superfluous we didnt care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.  oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there  is she sane asked mrs. linton appealing to me. ill repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you.  i dont mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with  well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.  with him and i wont be always sent off she continued kindling up. you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself  you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs. linton in surprise. but ill not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of heathcliffthat you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella  no you have not said the infatuated girl. i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him  i wouldnt be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely. nelly help me to convince her of her madness. tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. id as soon put that little canary into the park on a winters day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head. pray dont imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior hes not a rough diamonda pearlcontaining oyster of a rustic hes a fierce pitiless wolfish man. i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and hed crush you like a sparrows egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge. i know he couldnt love a linton and yet hed be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. theres my picture and im his friendso much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap.  miss linton regarded her sisterinlaw with indignation.  for shame for shame she repeated angrily. you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend  ah you wont believe me then said catherine. you think i speak from wicked selfishness  im certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you  good cried the other. try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.  and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs. linton left the room. all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation. but she uttered falsehoods didnt she mr. heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her  banish him from your thoughts miss i said. hes a bird of bad omen no mate for you. mrs. linton spoke strongly and yet i cant contradict her. she is better acquainted with his heart than i or any one besides and she never would represent him as worse than he is. honest people dont hide their deeds. how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr. earnshaw is worse and worse since he came. they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week agoit was joseph who told mei met him at gimmerton nelly he said wes hae a crowners quest enow at ahr folks. one on em s amost getten his finger cut off wi hauding t other fro stickin hisseln loike a cawlf. thats maister yah knaw at s soa up o going tuh t grand sizes. hes noan feared o t bench o

pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of heathcliffs conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you  you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied. ill not listen to your slanders. what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world  whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect. the day after there was a justicemeeting at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr. heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual. catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her. she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window. i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips. isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable.  come in thats right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire. here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose. heathcliff im proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself. i expect you to feel flattered. nay its not nelly dont look at her my poor little sisterinlaw is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. it lies in your own power to be edgars brother no no isabella you shant run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly. we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will have herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion  catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her id thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr. heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.  as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.  by no means cried mrs. linton in answer. i wont be named a dog in the manger again. you shall stay now then heathcliff why dont you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. im sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before yesterdays walk from sorrow and rage that i despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.  i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them. she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate  and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises. the poor thing couldnt bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainers with crescents of red.  theres a tigress exclaimed mrs. linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain. begone for gods sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him. cant you fancy the conclusions hell draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do executionyou must beware of your eyes.  id wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her. but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you  i assure you i was she returned. she has been dying for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. but dont notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness thats all. i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.  and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion. youd hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble lintons.  delectably observed catherine. they are doves eyesangels  shes her brothers heir is she not he asked after a brief silence.  i should be sorry to think so returned his companion. half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your neighbours goods remember this neighbours goods are mine.  if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short well dismiss the matter as you advise.  from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts. the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening. i saw him smile to himselfgrin ratherand lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs. linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment.  i determined to watch his movements. my heart invariably cleaved to the masters in preference to catherines side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and sheshe could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings. i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr. heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also. his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining. i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy.     chapter xi   sometimes while meditating on these things in solitude ive got up in a sudden terror and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm. ive persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways and then ive recollected his confirmed bad habits and hopeless of benefiting him have flinched from reentering the dismal house doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word.  one time i passed the old gate going out of my way on a journey to gimmerton. it was about the period that my narrative has reached a bright frosty afternoon the ground bare and the road hard and dry. i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand a rough sandpillar with the letters w. h. cut on its north side on the east g. and on the southwest t. g. it serves as a guidepost to the grange the heights and village. the sun shone yellow on its grey head reminding me of summer and i cannot say why but all at once a gush of childs sensations flowed into my heart. hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty years before. i gazed long at the weatherworn block and stooping down perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snailshells and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things and as fresh as reality it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf his dark square head bent forward and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. poor hindley i exclaimed involuntarily. i started my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine it vanished in a twinkling but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights. superstition urged me to comply with this impulse supposing he should be dead i thoughtor should die soonsupposing it were a sign of death the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb. the apparition had outstripped me it stood looking through the gate. that was my first idea on observing an elflocked browneyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. further reflection suggested this must be hareton my hareton not altered greatly since i left him ten months since.  god bless thee darling i cried forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears. hareton its nelly nelly thy nurse.  he retreated out of arms length and picked up a large flint.  i am come to see thy father hareton i added guessing from the action that nelly if she lived in his memory at all was not recognised as one with me.  he raised his missile to hurl it i commenced a soothing speech but could not stay his hand the stone struck my bonnet and then ensued from the stammering lips of the little fellow a string of curses which whether he comprehended them or not were delivered with practised emphasis and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity. you may be certain this grieved more than angered me. fit to cry i took an orange from my pocket and offered it to propitiate him. he hesitated and then snatched it from my hold as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him. i showed another keeping it out of his reach.  who has taught you those fine words my bairn i inquired. the curate  damn the curate and thee gie me that he replied.  tell us where you got your lessons and you shall have it said i. whos your master  devil daddy was his answer.  and what do you learn from daddy i continued.  he jumped at the fruit i raised it higher. what does he teach you i asked.  naught said he but to keep out of his gait. daddy cannot bide me because i swear at him.  ah and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy i observed.  aynay he drawled.  who then  heathcliff.  i asked if he liked mr. heathcliff.  ay he answered again.  desiring to have his reasons for liking him i could only gather the sentencesi knownt he pays dad back what he gies to mehe curses daddy for cursing me. he says i mun do as i will.  and the curate does not teach you to read and write then i pursued.  no i was told the curate should have his  teeth dashed down his  throat if he stepped over the thresholdheathcliff had promised that  i put the orange in his hand and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate. he went up the walk and entered the house but instead of hindley heathcliff appeared on the doorstones and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race making no halt till i gained the guidepost and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin. this is not much connected with miss isabellas affair except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange even though i should wake a domestic storm by thwarting mrs. lintons pleasure.  the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court. she had never spoken a word to her sisterinlaw for three days but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining and we found it a great comfort. heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss linton i knew. now as soon as he beheld her his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the housefront. i was standing by the kitchenwindow but i drew out of sight. he then stepped across the pavement to her and said something she seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away to prevent it he laid his hand on her arm. she averted her face he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. there was another rapid glance at the house and supposing himself unseen the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.  judas traitor i ejaculated. you are a hypocrite too are you a deliberate deceiver.  who is nelly said catherines voice at my elbow i had been overintent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.  your worthless friend i answered warmly the sneaking rascal yonder. ah he has caught a glimpse of ushe is coming in i wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss when he told you he hated her  mrs. linton saw isabella tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after heathcliff opened the door. i couldnt withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.  to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried. you want setting down in your right place heathcliff what are you about raising this stir i said you must let isabella alonei beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish linton to draw the bolts against you  god forbid that he should try answered the black villain. i detested him just then. god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven  hush said catherine shutting the inner door. dont vex me. why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose  what is it to you he growled. i have a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object. i am not your husband you neednt be jealous of me  im not jealous of you replied the mistress im jealous for you. clear your face you shant scowl at me if you like isabella you shall marry her. but do you like her tell the truth heathcliff there you wont answer. im certain you dont.  and would mr. linton approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired.  mr. linton should approve returned my lady decisively.  he might spare himself the trouble said heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation. and as to you catherine i have a mind to speak a few words now while we are at it. i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me infernallyinfernally do you hear and if you flatter yourself that i dont perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot and if you fancy ill suffer unrevenged ill convince you of the contrary in a very little while meantime thank you for telling me your sisterinlaws secret i swear ill make the most of it. and stand you aside  what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs. linton in amazement. ive treated you infernallyand youll take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally  i seek no revenge on you replied heathcliff less vehemently. thats not the plan. the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them. you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able. having levelled my palace dont erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel id cut my throat  oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine. well i wont repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul. your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery. you prove it. edgar is restored from the illtemper he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. quarrel with edgar if you please heathcliff and deceive his sister youll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.  the conversation ceased. mrs. linton sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy. the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it. he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine below so long.  ellen said he when i entered have you seen your mistress  yes shes in the kitchen sir i answered. shes sadly put out by mr. heathcliffs behaviour and indeed i do think its time to arrange his visits on another footing. theres harm in being too soft and now its come to this. and i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute. i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs. linton unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest. edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.  this is insufferable he exclaimed. it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me call me two men out of the hall ellen. catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffiani have humoured her enough.  he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen. its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs. linton at least was scolding with renewed vigour heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation.  how is this said linton addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too  have you been listening at the door edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation. heathcliff who had raised his eyes at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr. lintons attention to him. he succeeded but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.  ive been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance i acquiescedfoolishly. your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure. three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.  heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision.  cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said. it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. by god mr. linton im mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down  my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. i obeyed the hint but mrs. linton suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it.  fair means she said in answer to her husbands look of angry surprise. if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten. it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess. no ill swallow the key before you shall get it im delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each after constant indulgence of ones weak nature and the others bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me  it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master. he tried to wrest the key from catherines grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr. edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale. for his life he could not avert that excess of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face.  oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs. linton. we are vanquished we are vanquished heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice. cheer up you shant be hurt your type is not a lamb its a sucking leveret.  i wish you joy of the milkblooded coward cathy said her friend. i compliment you on your taste. and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but id kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction. is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear  the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push. hed better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man. it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr. linton walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance.  there youve done with coming here cried catherine. get away now hell return with a brace of pistols and halfadozen assistants. if he did overhear us of course hed never forgive you. youve played me an ill turn heathcliff but gomake haste id rather see edgar at bay than you.  do you suppose im going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered. by hell no ill crush his ribs in like a rotten hazelnut before i cross the threshold if i dont floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him  he is not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie. theres the coachman and the two gardeners youll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlourwindows to see that they fulfil his orders.  the gardeners and coachman were there but linton was with them. they had already entered the court. heathcliff on the second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in.  mrs. linton who was very much excited bade me accompany her upstairs. she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance.  im nearly distracted nelly she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa. a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head tell isabella to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild. and nelly say to edgar if you see him again tonight that im in danger of being seriously ill. i wish it may prove true. he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him. besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings im certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end will you do so my good nelly you are aware that i am no way blamable in this matter. what possessed him to turn listener heathcliffs talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella and the rest meant nothing. now all is dashed wrong by the fools craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon had edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it. really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long well if i cannot keep heathcliff for my friendif edgar will be mean and jealous ill try to break their hearts by breaking my own. that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but its a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope id not take linton by surprise with it. to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy. i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance and look rather more anxious about me.  the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness. therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together. he began to speak first.  remain where you are catherine he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency. i shall not stay. i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this evenings events you intend to continue your intimacy with  oh for mercys sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for mercys sake let us hear no more of it now your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of icewater but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.  to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr. linton. you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me. i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please. will you give up heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose.  i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine furiously. i demand it dont you see i can scarcely stand edgar youyou leave me  she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely. it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters mr. linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear. he told me to fetch some water. she had no breath for speaking. i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face. in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eyes while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death. linton looked terrified.  there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered. i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart.  she has blood on her lips he said shuddering.  never mind i answered tartly. and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started upher hair flying over her shoulders her eyes flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room. the master directed me to follow i did to her chamberdoor she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.  as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up. no she replied peremptorily. the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer. mr. linton on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his wifes occupations. isabella and he had had an hours interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for heathcliffs advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.     chapter xii   while miss linton moped about the park and garden always silent and almost always in tears and her brother shut himself up among books that he never openedwearying i guessed with a continual vague expectation that catherine repenting her conduct would come of her own accord to ask pardon and seek a reconciliationand she fasted pertinaciously under the idea probably that at every meal edgar was ready to choke for her absence and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet i went about my household duties convinced that the grange had but one sensible soul in its walls and that lodged in my body. i wasted no condolences on miss nor any expostulations on my mistress nor did i pay much attention to the sighs of my master who yearned to hear his ladys name since he might not hear her voice. i determined they should come about as they pleased for me and though it was a tiresomely slow process i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress as i thought at first.  mrs. linton on the third day unbarred her door and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter desired a renewed supply and a basin of gruel for she believed she was dying. that i set down as a speech meant for edgars ears i believed no such thing so i kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. she ate and drank eagerly and sank back on her pillow again clenching her hands and groaning. oh i will die she exclaimed since no one cares anything about me. i wish i had not taken that. then a good while after i heard her murmur no ill not diehed be gladhe does not love me at allhe would never miss me  did you want anything maam i inquired still preserving my external composure in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange exaggerated manner.  what is that apathetic being doing she demanded pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face. has he fallen into a lethargy or is he dead  neither replied i if you mean mr. linton. hes tolerably well i think though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought he is continually among his books since he has no other society.  i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition but i could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.  among his books she cried confounded. and i dying i on the brink of the grave my god does he know how im altered continued she staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall. is that catherine linton he imagines me in a petin play perhaps. cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest nelly if it be not too late as soon as i learn how he feels ill choose between these two either to starve at oncethat would be no punishment unless he had a heartor to recover and leave the country. are you speaking the truth about him now take care. is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life  why maam i answered the master has no idea of your being deranged and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.  you think not cannot you tell him i will she returned. persuade him speak of your own mind say you are certain i will  no you forget mrs. linton i suggested that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening and tomorrow you will perceive its good effects.  if i were only sure it would kill him she interrupted id kill myself directly these three awful nights ive never closed my lidsand oh ive been tormented ive been haunted nelly but i begin to fancy you dont like me. how strange i thought though everybody hated and despised each other they could not avoid loving me. and they have all turned to enemies in a few hours. they have im positive the people here. how dreary to meet death surrounded by their cold faces isabella terrified and repelled afraid to enter the room it would be so dreadful to watch catherine go. and edgar standing solemnly by to see it over then offering prayers of thanks to god for restoring peace to his house and going back to his books what in the name of all that feels has he to do with books when i am dying  she could not bear the notion which i had put into her head of mr. lintons philosophical resignation. tossing about she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness and tore the pillow with her teeth then raising herself up all burning desired that i would open the window. we were in the middle of winter the wind blew strong from the northeast and i objected. both the expressions flitting over her face and the changes of her moods began to alarm me terribly and brought to my recollection her former illness and the doctors injunction that she should not be crossed. a minute previously she was violent now supported on one arm and not noticing my refusal to obey her she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species her mind had strayed to other associations.  thats a turkeys she murmured to herself and this is a wild ducks and this is a pigeons. ah they put pigeons feathers in the pillowsno wonder i couldnt die let me take care to throw it on the floor when i lie down. and here is a moorcocks and thisi should know it among a thousandits a lapwings. bonny bird wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor. it wanted to get to its nest for the clouds had touched the swells and it felt rain coming. this feather was picked up from the heath the bird was not shot we saw its nest in the winter full of little skeletons. heathcliff set a trap over it and the old ones dared not come. i made him promise hed never shoot a lapwing after that and he didnt. yes here are more did he shoot my lapwings nelly are they red any of them let me look.  give over with that babywork i interrupted dragging the pillow away and turning the holes towards the mattress for she was removing its contents by handfuls. lie down and shut your eyes youre wandering. theres a mess the down is flying about like snow.  i went here and there collecting it.  i see in you nelly she continued dreamily an aged woman you have grey hair and bent shoulders. this bed is the fairy cave under penistone crags and you are gathering elfbolts to hurt our heifers pretending while i am near that they are only locks of wool. thats what youll come to fifty years hence i know you are not so now. im not wandering youre mistaken or else i should believe you really were that withered hag and i should think i was under penistone crags and im conscious its night and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet.  the black press where is that i asked. you are talking in your sleep  its against the wall as it always is she replied. it does appear oddi see a face in it  theres no press in the room and never was said i resuming my seat and looping up the curtain that i might watch her.  dont you see that face she inquired gazing earnestly at the mirror.  and say what i could i was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own so i rose and covered it with a shawl.  its behind there still she pursued anxiously. and it stirred. who is it i hope it will not come out when you are gone oh nelly the room is haunted im afraid of being alone  i took her hand in mine and bid her be composed for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass.  theres nobody here i insisted. it was yourself mrs. linton you knew it a while since.  myself she gasped and the clock is striking twelve its true then thats dreadful  her fingers clutched the clothes and gathered them over her eyes. i attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband but i was summoned back by a piercing shriekthe shawl had dropped from the frame.  why what is the matter cried i. who is coward now wake up that is the glassthe mirror mrs. linton and you see yourself in it and there am i too by your side.  trembling and bewildered she held me fast but the horror gradually passed from her countenance its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.  oh dear i thought i was at home she sighed. i thought i was lying in my chamber at wuthering heights. because im weak my brain got confused and i screamed unconsciously. dont say anything but stay with me. i dread sleeping my dreams appal me.  a sound sleep would do you good maam i answered and i hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.  oh if i were but in my own bed in the old house she went on bitterly wringing her hands. and that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice. do let me feel itit comes straight down the moordo let me have one breath  to pacify her i held the casement ajar a few seconds. a cold blast rushed through i closed it and returned to my post. she lay still now her face bathed in tears. exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit our fiery catherine was no better than a wailing child.  how long is it since i shut myself in here she asked suddenly reviving.  it was monday evening i replied and this is thursday night or rather friday morning at present.  what of the same week she exclaimed. only that brief time  long enough to live on nothing but cold water and illtemper observed i.  well it seems a weary number of hours she muttered doubtfully it must be more. i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled and edgar being cruelly provoking and me running into this room desperate. as soon as ever i had barred the door utter blackness overwhelmed me and i fell on the floor. i couldnt explain to edgar how certain i felt of having a fit or going raging mad if he persisted in teasing me i had no command of tongue or brain and he did not guess my agony perhaps it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice. before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear it began to be dawn and nelly ill tell you what i thought and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason. i thought as i lay there with my head against that table leg and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window that i was enclosed in the oakpanelled bed at home and my heart ached with some great grief which just waking i could not recollect. i pondered and worried myself to discover what it could be and most strangely the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank i did not recall that they had been at all. i was a child my father was just buried and my misery arose from the separation that hindley had ordered between me and heathcliff. i was laid alone for the first time and rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping i lifted my hand to push the panels aside it struck the tabletop i swept it along the carpet and then memory burst in my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched it must have been temporary derangement for there is scarcely cause. but supposing at twelve years old i had been wrenched from the heights and every early association and my all in all as heathcliff was at that time and been converted at a stroke into mrs. linton the lady of thrushcross grange and the wife of a stranger an exile and outcast thenceforth from what had been my world. you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled shake your head as you will nelly you have helped to unsettle me you should have spoken to edgar indeed you should and compelled him to leave me quiet oh im burning i wish i were out of doors i wish i were a girl again half savage and hardy and free and laughing at injuries not maddening under them why am i so changed why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words im sure i should be myself were i once among the heather on those hills. open the window again wide fasten it open quick why dont you move  because i wont give you your death of cold i answered.  you wont give me a chance of life you mean she said sullenly. however im not helpless yet ill open it myself.  and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her she crossed the room walking very uncertainly threw it back and bent out careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. i entreated and finally attempted to force her to retire. but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine she was delirious i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings. there was no moon and everything beneath lay in misty darkness not a light gleamed from any house far or near all had been extinguished long ago and those at wuthering heights were never visiblestill she asserted she caught their shining.  look she cried eagerly thats my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it and the other candle is in josephs garret. joseph sits up late doesnt he hes waiting till i come home that he may lock the gate. well hell wait a while yet. its a rough journey and a sad heart to travel it and we must pass by gimmerton kirk to go that journey weve braved its ghosts often together and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. but heathcliff if i dare you now will you venture if you do ill keep you. ill not lie there by myself they may bury me twelve feet deep and throw the church down over me but i wont rest till you are with me. i never will  she paused and resumed with a strange smile. hes consideringhed rather id come to him find a way then not through that kirkyard. you are slow be content you always followed me  perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity i was planning how i could reach something to wrap about her without quitting my hold of herself for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice when to my consternation i heard the rattle of the doorhandle and mr. linton entered. he had only then come from the library and in passing through the lobby had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity or fear to examine what it signified at that late hour.  oh sir i cried checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. my poor mistress is ill and she quite masters me i cannot manage her at all pray come and persuade her to go to bed. forget your anger for shes hard to guide any way but her own.  catherine ill he said hastening to us. shut the window ellen catherine why  he was silent. the haggardness of mrs. lintons appearance smote him speechless and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment.  shes been fretting here i continued and eating scarcely anything and never complaining she would admit none of us till this evening and so we couldnt inform you of her state as we were not aware of it ourselves but it is nothing.  i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly the master frowned. it is nothing is it ellen dean he said sternly. you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this and he took his wife in his arms and looked at her with anguish.  at first she gave him no glance of recognition he was invisible to her abstracted gaze. the delirium was not fixed however having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness by degrees she centred her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her.  ah you are come are you edgar linton she said with angry animation. you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted and when you are wanted never i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations nowi see we shallbut they cant keep me from my narrow home out yonder my restingplace where im bound before spring is over there it is not among the lintons mind under the chapelroof but in the open air with a headstone and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me  catherine what have you done commenced the master. am i nothing to you any more do you love that wretch heath  hush cried mrs. linton. hush this moment you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window what you touch at present you may have but my soul will be on that hilltop before you lay hands on me again. i dont want you edgar im past wanting you. return to your books. im glad you possess a consolation for all you had in me is gone.  her mind wanders sir i interposed. she has been talking nonsense the whole evening but let her have quiet and proper attendance and shell rally. hereafter we must be cautious how we vex her.  i desire no further advice from you answered mr. linton. you knew your mistresss nature and you encouraged me to harass her. and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days it was heartless months of sickness could not cause such a change  i began to defend myself thinking it too bad to be blamed for anothers wicked waywardness. i knew mrs. lintons nature to be headstrong and domineering cried i but i didnt know that you wished to foster her fierce temper i didnt know that to humour her i should wink at mr. heathcliff. i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you and i have got a faithful servants wages well it will teach me to be careful next time. next time you may gather intelligence for yourself  the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service ellen dean he replied.  youd rather hear nothing about it i suppose then mr. linton said i. heathcliff has your permission to come acourting to miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers on purpose to poison the mistress against you  confused as catherine was her wits were alert at applying our conversation.  ah nelly has played traitor she exclaimed passionately. nelly is my hidden enemy. you witch so you do seek elfbolts to hurt us let me go and ill make her rue ill make her howl a recantation  a maniacs fury kindled under her brows she struggled desperately to disengage herself from lintons arms. i felt no inclination to tarry the event and resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility i quitted the chamber.  in passing the garden to reach the road at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall i saw something white moved irregularly evidently by another agent than the wind. notwithstanding my hurry i stayed to examine it lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. my surprise and perplexity were great on discovering by touch more than vision miss isabellas springer fanny suspended by a handkerchief and nearly at its last gasp. i quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden. i had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed and wondered much how it could have got out there and what mischievous person had treated it so. while untying the knot round the hook it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought though it was a strange sound in that place at two oclock in the morning.  mr. kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street and my account of catherine lintons malady induced him to accompany me back immediately. he was a plain rough man and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before.  nelly dean said he i cant help fancying theres an extra cause for this. what has there been to do at the grange weve odd reports up here. a stout hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a trifle and that sort of people should not either. its hard work bringing them through fevers and such things. how did it begin  the master will inform you i answered but you are acquainted with the earnshaws violent dispositions and mrs. linton caps them all. i may say this it commenced in a quarrel. she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit. thats her account at least for she flew off in the height of it and locked herself up. afterwards she refused to eat and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream knowing those about her but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.  mr. linton will be sorry observed kenneth interrogatively.  sorry hell break his heart should anything happen i replied. dont alarm him more than necessary.  well i told him to beware said my companion and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning hasnt he been intimate with mr. heathcliff lately  heathcliff frequently visits at the grange answered i though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes his company. at present hes discharged from the trouble of calling owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss linton which he manifested. i hardly think hell be taken in again.  and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him was the doctors next question.  im not in her confidence returned i reluctant to continue the subject.  no shes a sly one he remarked shaking his head. she keeps her own counsel but shes a real little fool. i have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was she and heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours and he pressed her not to go in again but just mount his horse and away with him my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that when it was to be he didnt hear but you urge mr. linton to look sharp  this news filled me with fresh fears i outstripped kenneth and ran most of the way back. the little dog was yelping in the garden yet. i spared a minute to open the gate for it but instead of going to the house door it coursed up and down snuffing the grass and would have escaped to the road had i not seized it and conveyed it in with me. on ascending to isabellas room my suspicions were confirmed it was empty. had i been a few hours sooner mrs. lintons illness might have arrested her rash step. but what could be done now there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. i could not pursue them however and i dared not rouse the family and fill the place with confusion still less unfold the business to my master absorbed as he was in his present calamity and having no heart to spare for a second grief i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue and suffer matters to take their course and kenneth being arrived i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. catherine lay in a troubled sleep her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy he now hung over her pillow watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features.  the doctor on examining the case for himself spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity. to me he signified the threatening danger was not so much death as permanent alienation of intellect.  i did not close my eyes that night nor did mr. linton indeed we never went to bed and the servants were all up long before the usual hour moving through the house with stealthy tread and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. every one was active but miss isabella and they began to remark how sound she slept her brother too asked if she had risen and seemed impatient for her presence and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sisterinlaw. i trembled lest he should send me to call her but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. one of the maids a thoughtless girl who had been on an early errand to gimmerton came panting upstairs openmouthed and dashed into the chamber crying oh dear dear what mun we have next master master our young lady  hold your noise cried i hastily enraged at her clamorous manner.  speak lower marywhat is the matter said mr. linton. what ails your young lady  shes gone shes gone yon heathcliffs run off wi her gasped the girl.  that is not true exclaimed linton rising in agitation. it cannot be how has the idea entered your head ellen dean go and seek her. it is incredible it cannot be.  as he spoke he took the servant to the door and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.  why i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here she stammered and he asked whether we werent in trouble at the grange. i thought he meant for mississ sickness so i answered yes. then says he theres somebody gone after em i guess i stared. he saw i knew nought about it and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horses shoe fastened at a blacksmiths shop two miles out of gimmerton not very long after midnight and how the blacksmiths lass had got up to spy who they were she knew them both directly. and she noticed the manheathcliff it was she felt certain nobdy could mistake him besidesput a sovereign in her fathers hand for payment. the lady had a cloak about her face but having desired a sup of water while she drank it fell back and she saw her very plain. heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on and they set their faces from the village and went as fast as the rough roads would let them. the lass said nothing to her father but she told it all over gimmerton this morning.  i ran and peeped for forms sake into isabellas room confirming when i returned the servants statement. mr. linton had resumed his seat by the bed on my reentrance he raised his eyes read the meaning of my blank aspect and dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word.  are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back i inquired. how should we do  she went of her own accord answered the master she had a right to go if she pleased. trouble me no more about her. hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me.  and that was all he said on the subject he did not make a single inquiry further or mention her in any way except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home wherever it was when i knew it.     chapter xiii   for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs. linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever. no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her. day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxietyin fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanityhe knew no limits in gratitude and joy when catherines life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self.  the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march. mr. linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.  these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed. they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow. edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone  the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full. catherine last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you.  i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then youll leave me and i shall remain for ever. next spring youll long again to have me under this roof and youll look back and think you were happy today.  linton lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest words but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene. the master told me to light a fire in the manyweeks deserted parlour and to set an easychair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared. to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at presenton the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on edgars arm. ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was. and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr. lintons heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a strangers gripe by the birth of an heir.  i should mention that isabella sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with heathcliff. it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it. linton did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon. ill read it for i keep it yet. any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living.         dear ellen it beginsi came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine has been and is yet very ill. i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him. still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you.  inform edgar that id give the world to see his face againthat my heart returned to thrushcross grange in twentyfour hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine i cant follow it thoughthese words are underlinedthey need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection.  the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. i want to ask you two questions the first ishow did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here i cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.  the second question i have great interest in it is thisis mr. heathcliff a man if so is he mad and if not is he a devil i shant tell my reasons for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen very soon. dont write but come and bring me something from edgar.  now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be. it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them. i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream  the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six oclock and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the gardens and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse and your old fellowservant joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle. he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit. his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his underlip and turn away. then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle.  heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the kitchena dingy untidy hole i daresay you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge. by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.  this is edgars legal nephew i reflectedmine in a manner i must shake hands andyesi must kiss him. it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning.  i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist saidhow do you do my dear  he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend.  shall you and i be friends hareton was my next essay at conversation.  an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance.  hey throttler lad whispered the little wretch rousing a halfbred bulldog from its lair in a corner. now wilt thou be ganging he asked authoritatively.  love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter. mr. heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and repliedmim mim mim did iver christian body hear aught like it mincing un munching how can i tell whet ye say  i say i wish you to come with me into the house i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.  none o me i getten summut else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter im sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt.  i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself. after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eyes too were like a ghostly catherines with all their beauty annihilated.  whats your business here he demanded grimly. who are you  my name was isabella linton i replied. youve seen me before sir. im lately married to mr. heathcliff and he has brought me herei suppose by your permission.  is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf.  yeswe came just now i said but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bulldog.  its well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him.  i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and refastened the door. there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewterdishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust. i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr. earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. he walked up and down with his hands in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again.  youll not be surprised ellen at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four miles i could not overpass them i questioned with myselfwhere must i turn for comfort andmind you dont tell edgar or catherineabove every sorrow beside this rose preeminent despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling.  i sat and thought a doleful time the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals. i listened to detect a womans voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. i was not aware how openly i grieved till earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of newlyawakened surprise. taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimedim tired with my journey and i want to go to bed where is the maidservant direct me to her as she wont come to me  we have none he answered you must wait on yourself  where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding selfrespect weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.  joseph will show you heathcliffs chamber said he open that doorhes in there.  i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tonebe so good as to turn your lock and draw your boltdont omit it  well i said. but why mr. earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff.  look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiouslyconstructed pistol having a doubleedged spring knife attached to the barrel. thats a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door. if once i find it open hes done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him. you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the time comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him  i surveyed the weapon inquisitively. a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade. he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness. he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment.  i dont care if you tell him said he. put him on his guard and watch for him. you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you.  what has heathcliff done to you i asked. in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred wouldnt it be wiser to bid him quit the house  no thundered earnshaw should he offer to leave me hes a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton to be a beggar oh damnation i will have it back and ill have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before  youve acquainted me ellen with your old masters habits. he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least. i shuddered to be near him and thought on the servants illbred moroseness as comparatively agreeable. he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen. joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply ill make the porridge i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and ridinghabit. mr. earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will. im not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve.  gooid lord he muttered sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle. if theres to be fresh ortheringsjust when i getten used to two maisters if i mun hev a mistress set oer my heead its like time to be flitting. i niver did think to see t day that i mud lave th owld placebut i doubt its nigh at hand  this lamentation drew no notice from me i went briskly to work sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition the quicker the thible ran round and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water. joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation.  thear he ejaculated. hareton thou willnt sup thy porridge toneeght theyll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. thear agean id fling in bowl un all if i wer ye there pale t guilp off un then yell hae done wit. bang bang. its a mercy t bothom isnt deaved out  it was rather a rough mess i own when poured into the basins four had been provided and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy which hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip. i expostulated and desired that he should have his in a mug affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily. the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety assuring me repeatedly that the barn was every bit as good as i and every bit as wollsome and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited. meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking and glowered up at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug.  i shall have my supper in another room i said. have you no place you call a parlour  parlour he echoed sneeringly parlour nay weve noa parlours. if yah dunnut loike wer company theres maisters un if yah dunnut loike maister theres us.  then i shall go upstairs i answered show me a chamber.  i put my basin on a tray and went myself to fetch some more milk. with great grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent we mounted to the garrets he opened a door now and then to look into the apartments we passed.  heres a rahm he said at last flinging back a cranky board on hinges. its weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. theres a pack o corn i t corner thear meeterly clane if yere feared o muckying yer grand silk cloes spread yer hankerchir o t top ont.  the rahm was a kind of lumberhole smelling strong of malt and grain various sacks of which articles were piled around leaving a wide bare space in the middle.  why man i exclaimed facing him angrily this is not a place to sleep in. i wish to see my bedroom.  bedrume he repeated in a tone of mockery. yahs see all t bedrumes thear isyons mine.  he pointed into the second garret only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls and having a large low curtainless bed with an indigocoloured quilt at one end.  what do i want with yours i retorted. i suppose mr. heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house does he  oh its maister hathecliffs yere wanting cried he as if making a new discovery. couldnt ye ha said soa at onst un then i mud ha telled ye baht all this wark that thats just one ye cannut seehe allas keeps it locked un nobdy iver mells ont but hisseln.  youve a nice house joseph i could not refrain from observing and pleasant inmates and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs however that is not to the present purposethere are other rooms. for heavens sake be quick and let me settle somewhere  he made no reply to this adjuration only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps and halting before an apartment which from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture i conjectured to be the best one. there was a carpeta good one but the pattern was obliterated by dust a fireplace hung with cutpaper dropping to pieces a handsome oakbedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make but they had evidently experienced rough usage the vallances hung in festoons wrenched from their rings and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side causing the drapery to trail upon the floor. the chairs were also damaged many of them severely and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession when my fool of a guide announcedthis here is t maisters. my supper by this time was cold my appetite gone and my patience exhausted. i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose.  whear the divil began the religious elder. the lord bless us the lord forgie us whear the hell wold ye gang ye marred wearisome nowt yeve seen all but haretons bit of a chamer. theres not another hoile to lig down in i th hahse  i was so vexed i flung my tray and its contents on the ground and then seated myself at the stairshead hid my face in my hands and cried.  ech ech exclaimed joseph. weel done miss cathy weel done miss cathy howsiver t maister sall just tumle oer them brocken pots un then wes hear summut wes hear how its to be. gooidfornaught madling ye desarve pining fro this to churstmas flinging t precious gifts uh god under fooit i yer flaysome rages but im mistaen if ye shew yer sperrit lang. will hathecliff bide sich bonny ways think ye i nobbut wish he may catch ye i that plisky. i nobbut wish he may.  and so he went on scolding to his den beneath taking the candle with him and i remained in the dark. the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath and bestirring myself to remove its effects. an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler whom i now recognised as a son of our old skulker it had spent its whelphood at the grange and was given by my father to mr. hindley. i fancy it knew me it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute and then hastened to devour the porridge while i groped from step to step collecting the shattered earthenware and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pockethandkerchief. our labours were scarcely over when i heard earnshaws tread in the passage my assistant tucked in his tail and pressed to the wall i stole into the nearest doorway. the dogs endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful as i guessed by a scutter downstairs and a prolonged piteous yelping. i had better luck he passed on entered his chamber and shut the door. directly after joseph came up with hareton to put him to bed. i had found shelter in haretons room and the old man on seeing me saidtheys rahm for boath ye un yer pride now i sud think i the hahse. its empty ye may hev it all to yerseln un him as allas maks a third i sich ill company  gladly did i take advantage of this intimation and the minute i flung myself into a chair by the fire i nodded and slept. my slumber was deep and sweet though over far too soon. mr. heathcliff awoke me he had just come in and demanded in his loving manner what i was doing there i told him the cause of my staying up so latethat he had the key of our room in his pocket. the adjective our gave mortal offence. he swore it was not nor ever should be mine and hedbut ill not repeat his language nor describe his habitual conduct he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear yet i assure you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens. he told me of catherines illness and accused my brother of causing it promising that i should be edgars proxy in suffering till he could get hold of him.  i do hate himi am wretchedi have been a fool beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the grange. i shall expect you every daydont disappoint meisabella.     chapter xiv   as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs. lintons situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me.  forgiveness said linton. i have nothing to forgive her ellen. you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but im sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think shell be happy. it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.  and you wont write her a little note sir i asked imploringly.  no he answered. it is needless. my communication with heathcliffs family shall be as sparing as his with mine. it shall not exist  mr. edgars coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella. i daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed. i entered without knocking. there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented i must confess that if i had been in the young ladys place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster. but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head. probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening. hindley was not there. mr. heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his pocketbook but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair. he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better. so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter. i shook my head. she wouldnt understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought. heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manuvres and saidif you have got anything for isabella as no doubt you have nelly give it to her. you neednt make a secret of it we have no secrets between us.  oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once. my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present. he sends his love maam and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing could come of keeping it up.  mrs. heathcliffs lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window. her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine. i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by crossexamination most of the facts connected with its origin. i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr. lintons example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil.  mrs. linton is now just recovering i said shell never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her youll shun crossing her way again nay youll move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it ill inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw as that young lady is different from me. her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty  that is quite possible remarked heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that youll get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her what do you say  i say mr. heathcliff i replied you must not you never shall through my means. another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether.  with your aid that may be avoided he continued and should there be danger of such an eventshould he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existencewhy i think i shall be justified in going to extremes i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine would suffer greatly from his loss the fear that she would restrains me. and there you see the distinction between our feelings had he been in my place and i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i never would have raised a hand against him. you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his. the moment her regard ceased i would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood but till thenif you dont believe me you dont know metill then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head  and yet i interrupted you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now when she has nearly forgotten you and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress.  you suppose she has nearly forgotten me he said. oh nelly you know she has not you know as well as i do that for every thought she spends on linton she spends a thousand on me at a most miserable period of my life i had a notion of the kind it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again. and then linton would be nothing nor hindley nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt. two words would comprehend my futuredeath and hell existence after losing her would be hell. yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar lintons attachment more than mine. if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he couldnt love as much in eighty years as i could in a day. and catherine has a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contained in that horsetrough as her whole affection be monopolised by him. tush he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse. it is not in him to be loved like me how can she love in him what he has not  catherine and edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be cried isabella with sudden vivacity. no one has a right to talk in that manner and i wont hear my brother depreciated in silence  your brother is wondrous fond of you too isnt he observed heathcliff scornfully. he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.  he is not aware of what i suffer she replied. i didnt tell him that.  you have been telling him something then you have written have you  to say that i was married i did writeyou saw the note.  and nothing since  no.  my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition i remarked. somebodys love comes short in her case obviously whose i may guess but perhaps i shouldnt say.  i should guess it was her own said heathcliff. she degenerates into a mere slut she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early. youd hardly credit it but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home. however shell suit this house so much the better for not being over nice and ill take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.  well sir returned i i hope youll consider that mrs. heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom every one was ready to serve. you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her and you must treat her kindly. whatever be your notion of mr. edgar you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she wouldnt have abandoned the elegancies and comforts and friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with you.  she abandoned them under a delusion he answered picturing in me a hero of romance and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. but at last i think she begins to know me i dont perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself. it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her. i believed at one time no lessons could teach her that and yet it is poorly learnt for this morning she announced as a piece of appalling intelligence that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me a positive labour of hercules i assure you if it be achieved i have cause to return thanks. can i trust your assertion isabella are you sure you hate me if i let you alone for half a day wont you come sighing and wheedling to me again i daresay she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. but i dont care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side and i never told her a lie about it. she cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. the first thing she saw me do on coming out of the grange was to hang up her little dog and when she pleaded for it the first words i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her except one possibly she took that exception for herself. but no brutality disgusted her i suppose she has an innate admiration of it if only her precious person were secure from injury now was it not the depth of absurdityof genuine idiocy for that pitiful slavish meanminded brach to dream that i could love her tell your master nelly that i never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she is. she even disgraces the name of linton and ive sometimes relented from pure lack of invention in my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back but tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease that i keep strictly within the limits of the law. i have avoided up to this period giving her the slightest right to claim a separation and whats more shed thank nobody for dividing us. if she desired to go she might the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her  mr. heathcliff said i this is the talk of a madman your wife most likely is convinced you are mad and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto but now that you say she may go shell doubtless avail herself of the permission. you are not so bewitched maam are you as to remain with him of your own accord  take care ellen answered isabella her eyes sparkling irefully there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partners endeavours to make himself detested. dont put faith in a single word he speaks. hes a lying fiend a monster and not a human being ive been told i might leave him before and ive made the attempt but i dare not repeat it only ellen promise youll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine. whatever he may pretend he wishes to provoke edgar to desperation he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him and he shant obtain itill die first i just hope i pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me the single pleasure i can imagine is to die or to see him dead  therethat will do for the present said heathcliff. if you are called upon in a court of law youll remember her language nelly and take a good look at that countenance shes near the point which would suit me. no youre not fit to be your own guardian isabella now and i being your legal protector must retain you in my custody however distasteful the obligation may be. go upstairs i have something to say to ellen dean in private. thats not the way upstairs i tell you why this is the road upstairs child  he seized and thrust her from the room and returned mutteringi have no pity i have no pity the more the worms writhe the more i yearn to crush out their entrails it is a moral teething and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.  do you understand what the word pity means i said hastening to resume my bonnet. did you ever feel a touch of it in your life  put that down he interrupted perceiving my intention to depart. you are not going yet. come here now nelly i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine and that without delay. i swear that i meditate no harm i dont desire to cause any disturbance or to exasperate or insult mr. linton i only wish to hear from herself how she is and why she has been ill and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her. last night i was in the grange garden six hours and ill return there tonight and every night ill haunt the place and every day till i find an opportunity of entering. if edgar linton meets me i shall not hesitate to knock him down and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay. if his servants oppose me i shall threaten them off with these pistols. but wouldnt it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master and you could do it so easily. id warn you when i came and then you might let me in unobserved as soon as she was alone and watch till i departed your conscience quite calm you would be hindering mischief.  i protested against playing that treacherous part in my employers house and besides i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs. lintons tranquillity for his satisfaction. the commonest occurrence startles her painfully i said. shes all nerves and she couldnt bear the surprise im positive. dont persist sir or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs and hell take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions  in that case ill take measures to secure you woman exclaimed heathcliff you shall not leave wuthering heights till tomorrow morning. it is a foolish story to assert that catherine could not bear to see me and as to surprising her i dont desire it you must prepare herask her if i may come. you say she never mentions my name and that i am never mentioned to her. to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house she thinks you are all spies for her husband. oh ive no doubt shes in hell among you i guess by her silence as much as anything what she feels. you say she is often restless and anxiouslooking is that a proof of tranquillity you talk of her mind being unsettled. how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation and that insipid paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity from pity and charity he might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares let us settle it at once will you stay here and am i to fight my way to catherine over linton and his footman or will you be my friend as you have been hitherto and do what i request decide because there is no reason for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn illnature  well mr. lockwood i argued and complained and flatly refused him fifty times but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress and should she consent i promised to let him have intelligence of lintons next absence from home when he might come and get in as he was able i wouldnt be there and my fellowservants should be equally out of the way. was it right or wrong i fear it was wrong though expedient. i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance and i thought too it might create a favourable crisis in catherines mental illness and then i remembered mr. edgars stern rebuke of my carrying tales and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject by affirming with frequent iteration that that betrayal of trust if it merited so harsh an appellation should be the last. notwithstanding my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither and many misgivings i had ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs. lintons hand.  but here is kenneth ill go down and tell him how much better you are. my history is dree as we say and will serve to while away another morning.         dree and dreary i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me. but never mind ill extract wholesome medicines from mrs. deans bitter herbs and firstly let me beware of the fascination that lurks in catherine heathcliffs brilliant eyes. i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.     chapter xv   another week overand i am so many days nearer health and spring i have now heard all my neighbours history at different sittings as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. ill continue it in her own words only a little condensed. she is on the whole a very fair narrator and i dont think i could improve her style.         in the evening she said the evening of my visit to the heights i knew as well as if i saw him that mr. heathcliff was about the place and i shunned going out because i still carried his letter in my pocket and didnt want to be threatened or teased any more. i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine. the consequence was that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days. the fourth was sunday and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church. there was a man servant left to keep the house with me and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open and to fulfil my engagement as i knew who would be coming i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges and he must run over to the village and get a few to be paid for on the morrow. he departed and i went upstairs.  mrs. linton sat in a loose white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders in the recess of the open window as usual. her thick long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck. her appearance was altered as i had told heathcliff but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. the flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her they appeared always to gaze beyond and far beyondyou would have said out of this world. then the paleness of her faceits haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered fleshand the peculiar expression arising from her mental state though painfully suggestive of their causes added to the touching interest which she awakened andinvariably to me i know and to any person who saw her i should thinkrefuted more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay.  a book lay spread on the sill before her and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals. i believe linton had laid it there for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement. she was conscious of his aim and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses. at other times she would turn petulantly away and hide her face in her hands or even push him off angrily and then he took care to let her alone for he was certain of doing no good.  gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing and the full mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf. at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain. and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking as she listened that is if she thought or listened at all but she had the vague distant look i mentioned before which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.  theres a letter for you mrs. linton i said gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee. you must read it immediately because it wants an answer. shall i break the seal yes she answered without altering the direction of her eyes. i opened itit was very short. now i continued read it. she drew away her hand and let it fall. i replaced it in her lap and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down but that movement was so long delayed that at last i resumedmust i read it maam it is from mr. heathcliff.  there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection and a struggle to arrange her ideas. she lifted the letter and seemed to peruse it and when she came to the signature she sighed yet still i found she had not gathered its import for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness.  well he wishes to see you said i guessing her need of an interpreter. hes in the garden by this time and impatient to know what answer i shall bring.  as i spoke i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark and then smoothing them back announce by a wag of the tail that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger. mrs. linton bent forward and listened breathlessly. the minute after a step traversed the hall the open house was too tempting for heathcliff to resist walking in most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise and so resolved to trust to his own audacity. with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber. he did not hit the right room directly she motioned me to admit him but he found it out ere i could reach the door and in a stride or two was at her side and had her grasped in his arms.  he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before i daresay but then my mistress had kissed him first and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into her face the same conviction had stricken him as me from the instant he beheld her that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery thereshe was fated sure to die.  oh cathy oh my life how can i bear it was the first sentence he uttered in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes but they burned with anguish they did not melt.  what now said catherine leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices. you and edgar have broken my heart heathcliff and you both come to bewail the deed to me as if you were the people to be pitied i shall not pity you not i. you have killed meand thriven on it i think. how strong you are how many years do you mean to live after i am gone  heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her he attempted to rise but she seized his hair and kept him down.  i wish i could hold you she continued bitterly till we were both dead i shouldnt care what you suffered. i care nothing for your sufferings. why shouldnt you suffer i do will you forget me will you be happy when i am in the earth will you say twenty years hence thats the grave of catherine earnshaw i loved her long ago and was wretched to lose her but it is past. ive loved many others since my children are dearer to me than she was and at death i shall not rejoice that i am going to her i shall be sorry that i must leave them will you say so heathcliff  dont torture me till im as mad as yourself cried he wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth.  the two to a cool spectator made a strange and fearful picture. well might catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. as to her companion while raising himself with one hand he had taken her arm with the other and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.  are you possessed with a devil he pursued savagely to talk in that manner to me when you are dying do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory and eating deeper eternally after you have left me you know you lie to say i have killed you and catherine you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell  i shall not be at peace moaned catherine recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent unequal throbbing of her heart which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly  im not wishing you greater torment than i have heathcliff. i only wish us never to be parted and should a word of mine distress you hereafter think i feel the same distress underground and for my own sake forgive me come here and kneel down again you never harmed me in your life. nay if you nurse anger that will be worse to remember than my harsh words wont you come here again do  heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over but not so far as to let her see his face which was livid with emotion. she bent round to look at him he would not permit it turning abruptly he walked to the fireplace where he stood silent with his back towards us. mrs. lintons glance followed him suspiciously every movement woke a new sentiment in her. after a pause and a prolonged gaze she resumed addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment  oh you see nelly he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave. that is how im loved well never mind. that is not my heathcliff. i shall love mine yet and take him with me hes in my soul. and added she musingly the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison after all. im tired of being enclosed here. im wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it. nelly you think you are better and more fortunate than i in full health and strength you are sorry for mevery soon that will be altered. i shall be sorry for you. i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. i wonder he wont be near me she went on to herself. i thought he wished it. heathcliff dear you should not be sullen now. do come to me heathcliff.  in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair. at that earnest appeal he turned to her looking absolutely desperate. his eyes wide and wet at last flashed fiercely on her his breast heaved convulsively. an instant they held asunder and then how they met i hardly saw but catherine made a spring and he caught her and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive in fact to my eyes she seemed directly insensible. he flung himself into the nearest seat and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted he gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy. i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species it appeared that he would not understand though i spoke to him so i stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity.  a movement of catherines relieved me a little presently she put up her hand to clasp his neck and bring her cheek to his as he held her while he in return covering her with frantic caresses said wildly  you teach me now how cruel youve beencruel and false. why did you despise me why did you betray your own heart cathy i have not one word of comfort. you deserve this. you have killed yourself. yes you may kiss me and cry and wring out my kisses and tears theyll blight youtheyll damn you. you loved methen what right had you to leave me what rightanswer mefor the poor fancy you felt for linton because misery and degradation and death and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us you of your own will did it. i have not broken your heartyou have broken it and in breaking it you have broken mine. so much the worse for me that i am strong. do i want to live what kind of living will it be when youoh god would you like to live with your soul in the grave  let me alone. let me alone sobbed catherine. if ive done wrong im dying for it. it is enough you left me too but i wont upbraid you i forgive you. forgive me  it is hard to forgive and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted hands he answered. kiss me again and dont let me see your eyes i forgive what you have done to me. i love my murdererbut yours how can i  they were silenttheir faces hid against each other and washed by each others tears. at least i suppose the weeping was on both sides as it seemed heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.  i grew very uncomfortable meanwhile for the afternoon wore fast away the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand and i could distinguish by the shine of the western sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch.  service is over i announced. my master will be here in half an hour.  heathcliff groaned a curse and strained catherine closer she never moved.  ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing. mr. linton was not far behind he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.  now he is here i exclaimed. for heavens sake hurry down youll not meet any one on the front stairs. do be quick and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.  i must go cathy said heathcliff seeking to extricate himself from his companions arms. but if i live ill see you again before you are asleep. i wont stray five yards from your window.  you must not go she answered holding him as firmly as her strength allowed. you shall not i tell you.  for one hour he pleaded earnestly.  not for one minute she replied.  i mustlinton will be up immediately persisted the alarmed intruder.  he would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the actshe clung fast gasping there was mad resolution in her face.  no she shrieked. oh dont dont go. it is the last time edgar will not hurt us. heathcliff i shall die i shall die  damn the fool there he is cried heathcliff sinking back into his seat. hush my darling hush hush catherine ill stay. if he shot me so id expire with a blessing on my lips.  and there they were fast again. i heard my master mounting the stairsthe cold sweat ran from my forehead i was horrified.  are you going to listen to her ravings i said passionately. she does not know what she says. will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself get up you could be free instantly. that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did. we are all done formaster mistress and servant.  i wrung my hands and cried out and mr. linton hastened his step at the noise. in the midst of my agitation i was sincerely glad to observe that catherines arms had fallen relaxed and her head hung down.  shes fainted or dead i thought so much the better. far better that she should be dead than lingering a burden and a miserymaker to all about her.  edgar sprang to his unbidden guest blanched with astonishment and rage. what he meant to do i cannot tell however the other stopped all demonstrations at once by placing the lifelesslooking form in his arms.  look there he said. unless you be a fiend help her firstthen you shall speak to me  he walked into the parlour and sat down. mr. linton summoned me and with great difficulty and after resorting to many means we managed to restore her to sensation but she was all bewildered she sighed and moaned and knew nobody. edgar in his anxiety for her forgot her hated friend. i did not. i went at the earliest opportunity and besought him to depart affirming that catherine was better and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.  i shall not refuse to go out of doors he answered but i shall stay in the garden and nelly mind you keep your word tomorrow. i shall be under those larchtrees. mind or i pay another visit whether linton be in or not.  he sent a rapid glance through the halfopen door of the chamber and ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true delivered the house of his luckless presence.     chapter xvi   about twelve oclock that night was born the catherine you saw at wuthering heights a puny sevenmonths child and two hours after the mother died having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss heathcliff or know edgar. the latters distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on its aftereffects showed how deep the sorrow sunk. a great addition in my eyes was his being left without an heir. i bemoaned that as i gazed on the feeble orphan and i mentally abused old linton for what was only natural partiality the securing his estate to his own daughter instead of his sons. an unwelcomed infant it was poor thing it might have wailed out of life and nobody cared a morsel during those first hours of existence. we redeemed the neglect afterwards but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.  next morningbright and cheerful out of doorsstole softened in through the blinds of the silent room and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow tender glow. edgar linton had his head laid on the pillow and his eyes shut. his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him and almost as fixed but his was the hush of exhausted anguish and hers of perfect peace. her brow smooth her lids closed her lips wearing the expression of a smile no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared. and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest. i instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before incomparably beyond and above us all whether still on earth or now in heaven her spirit is at home with god  i dont know if it be a peculiarity in me but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me. i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafterthe eternity they have enteredwhere life is boundless in its duration and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness. i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr. lintons when he so regretted catherines blessed release to be sure one might have doubted after the wayward and impatient existence she had led whether she merited a haven of peace at last. one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection but not then in the presence of her corpse. it asserted its own tranquillity which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.  do you believe such people are happy in the other world sir id give a great deal to know.  i declined answering mrs. deans question which struck me as something heterodox. she proceeded  retracing the course of catherine linton i fear we have no right to think she is but well leave her with her maker.  the master looked asleep and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air. the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch in reality my chief motive was seeing mr. heathcliff. if he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange unless perhaps he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton. if he had come nearer he would probably be aware from the lights flitting to and fro and the opening and shutting of the outer doors that all was not right within. i wished yet feared to find him. i felt the terrible news must be told and i longed to get it over but how to do it i did not know. he was thereat least a few yards further in the park leant against an old ashtree his hat off and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches and fell pattering round him. he had been standing a long time in that position for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him busy in building their nest and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. they flew off at my approach and he raised his eyes and spokeshes dead he said ive not waited for you to learn that. put your handkerchief awaydont snivel before me. damn you all she wants none of your tears  i was weeping as much for him as her we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. when i first looked into his face i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.  yes shes dead i answered checking my sobs and drying my cheeks. gone to heaven i hope where we may every one join her if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good  did she take due warning then asked heathcliff attempting a sneer. did she die like a saint come give me a true history of the event. how did  he endeavoured to pronounce the name but could not manage it and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony defying meanwhile my sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare. how did she die he resumed at lastfain notwithstanding his hardihood to have a support behind him for after the struggle he trembled in spite of himself to his very fingerends.  poor wretch i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men why should you be anxious to conceal them your pride cannot blind god you tempt him to wring them till he forces a cry of humiliation.  quietly as a lamb i answered aloud. she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and nothing more  anddid she ever mention me he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear.  her senses never returned she recognised nobody from the time you left her i said. she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. her life closed in a gentle dreammay she wake as kindly in the other world  may she wake in torment he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion. why shes a liar to the end where is she not therenot in heavennot perishedwhere oh you said you cared nothing for my sufferings and i pray one prayeri repeat it till my tongue stiffenscatherine earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed youhaunt me then the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe. i know that ghosts have wandered on earth. be with me alwaystake any formdrive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i cannot live without my life i cannot live without my soul  he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eyes howled not like a man but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears. i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night. it hardly moved my compassionit appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so. but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed. he was beyond my skill to quiet or console  mrs. lintons funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great drawingroom. linton spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian anda circumstance concealed from all but meheathcliff spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose. i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the windows moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise. indeed i shouldnt have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpses face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round catherines neck. heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own. i twisted the two and enclosed them together.  mr. earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants. isabella was not asked.  the place of catherines interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside. it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberryplants have climbed over it from the moor and peatmould almost buries it. her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves.     chapter xvii   that friday made the last of our fine days for a month. in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to northeast and brought rain first and then sleet and snow. on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute. i supposed it one of the maids and i criedhave done how dare you show your giddiness here what would mr. linton say if he heard you  excuse me answered a familiar voice but i know edgar is in bed and i cannot stop myself.  with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side.  i have run the whole way from wuthering heights she continued after a pause except where ive flown. i couldnt count the number of falls ive had. oh im aching all over dont be alarmed there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.  the intruder was mrs. heathcliff. she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck. the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her.  my dear young lady i exclaimed ill stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton tonight so it is needless to order the carriage.  certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet ive no objection to dress myself decently. andah see how it flows down my neck now the fire does make it smart.  she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.  now ellen she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easychair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor catherines baby away i dont like to see it you mustnt think i care little for catherine because i behaved so foolishly on entering ive cried too bitterlyyes more than any one else has reason to cry. we parted unreconciled you remember and i shant forgive myself. but for all that i was not going to sympathise with himthe brute beast oh give me the poker this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor. ill smash it she continued striking it with childish spite and then ill burn it and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals. there he shall buy another if he gets me back again. hed be capable of coming to seek me to tease edgar. i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head and besides edgar has not been kind has he and i wont come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble. necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way id have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursedof that incarnate goblin ah he was in such a fury if he had caught me its a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength i wouldnt have run till id seen him all but demolished had hindley been able to do it  well dont talk so fast miss i interrupted youll disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again. drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition  an undeniable truth she replied. listen to that child it maintains a constant wailsend it out of my hearing for an hour i shant stay any longer.  i rang the bell and committed it to a servants care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us.  i ought and i wished to remain answered she to cheer edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home. but i tell you he wouldnt let me do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merrycould bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion. it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away. ive recovered from my first desire to be killed by him id rather hed kill himself he has extinguished my love effectually and so im at my ease. i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him ifno no even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well. monster would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory  hush hush hes a human being i said. be more charitable there are worse men than he is yet  hes not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity. i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me. people feel with their hearts ellen and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine no indeed indeed i wouldnt and here isabella began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced. you asked what has driven me to flight at last i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity. pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head. he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence. i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of selfpreservation so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.  yesterday you know mr. earnshaw should have been at the funeral. he kept himself sober for the purposetolerably sober not going to bed mad at six oclock and getting up drunk at twelve. consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.  heathcliffi shudder to name him has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till today. whether the angels have fed him or his kin beneath i cannot tell but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week. he has just come home at dawn and gone upstairs to his chamber locking himself inas if anybody dreamt of coveting his company there he has continued praying like a methodist only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes and god when addressed was curiously confounded with his own black father after concluding these precious orisonsand they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throathe would be off again always straight down to the grange i wonder edgar did not send for a constable and give him into custody for me grieved as i was about catherine it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.  i recovered spirits sufficient to hear josephs eternal lectures without weeping and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly. you wouldnt think that i should cry at anything joseph could say but he and hareton are detestable companions. id rather sit with hindley and hear his awful talk than with t little maister and his staunch supporter that odious old man when heathcliff is in im often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers when he is not as was the case this week i establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire and never mind how mr. earnshaw may occupy himself and he does not interfere with my arrangements. he is quieter now than he used to be if no one provokes him more sullen and depressed and less furious. joseph affirms hes sure hes an altered man that the lord has touched his heart and he is saved so as by fire. im puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change but it is not my business.  yesterevening i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve. it seemed so dismal to go upstairs with the wild snow blowing outside and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the newmade grave i dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place. hindley sat opposite his head leant on his hand perhaps meditating on the same subject. he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours. there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind which shook the windows every now and then the faint crackling of the coals and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle. hareton and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. it was very very sad and while i read i sighed for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world never to be restored.  the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual owing i suppose to the sudden storm. that entrance was fastened and we heard him coming round to get in by the other. i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips which induced my companion who had been staring towards the door to turn and look at me.  ill keep him out five minutes he exclaimed. you wont object  no you may keep him out the whole night for me i answered. do put the key in the lock and draw the bolts.  earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table leaning over it and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his as he both looked and felt like an assassin he couldnt exactly find that but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.  you and i he said have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder if we were neither of us cowards we might combine to discharge it. are you as soft as your brother are you willing to endure to the last and not once attempt a repayment  im weary of enduring now i replied and id be glad of a retaliation that wouldnt recoil on myself but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies.  treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence cried hindley. mrs. heathcliff ill ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb. tell me now can you im sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the fiends existence hell be your death unless you overreach him and hell be my ruin. damn the hellish villain he knocks at the door as if he were master here already promise to hold your tongue and before that clock strikesit wants three minutes of oneyoure a free woman  he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast and would have turned down the candle. i snatched it away however and seized his arm.  ill not hold my tongue i said you mustnt touch him. let the door remain shut and be quiet  no ive formed my resolution and by god ill execute it cried the desperate being. ill do you a kindness in spite of yourself and hareton justice and you neednt trouble your head to screen me catherine is gone. nobody alive would regret me or be ashamed though i cut my throat this minuteand its time to make an end  i might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic. the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him.  youd better seek shelter somewhere else tonight i exclaimed in rather a triumphant tone. mr. earnshaw has a mind to shoot you if you persist in endeavouring to enter.  youd better open the door you he answered addressing me by some elegant term that i dont care to repeat.  i shall not meddle in the matter i retorted again. come in and get shot if you please. ive done my duty.  with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him. earnshaw swore passionately at me affirming that i loved the villain yet and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced. and i in my secret heart and conscience never reproached me thought what a blessing it would be for him should heathcliff put him out of misery and what a blessing for me should he send heathcliff to his right abode as i sat nursing these reflections the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual and his black countenance looked blightingly through. the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow and i smiled exulting in my fancied security. his hair and clothes were whitened with snow and his sharp cannibal teeth revealed by cold and wrath gleamed through the dark.  isabella let me in or ill make you repent he girned as joseph calls it.  i cannot commit murder i replied. mr. hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol.  let me in by the kitchen door he said.  hindley will be there before me i answered and thats a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow we were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone but the moment a blast of winter returns you must run for shelter heathcliff if i were you id go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. the world is surely not worth living in now is it you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine was the whole joy of your life i cant imagine how you think of surviving her loss.  hes there is he exclaimed my companion rushing to the gap. if i can get my arm out i can hit him  im afraid ellen youll set me down as really wicked but you dont know all so dont judge. i wouldnt have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything. wish that he were dead i must and therefore i was fearfully disappointed and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on earnshaws weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.  the charge exploded and the knife in springing back closed into its owners wrist. heathcliff pulled it away by main force slitting up the flesh as it passed on and thrust it dripping into his pocket. he then took a stone struck down the division between two windows and sprang in. his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large vein. the ruffian kicked and trampled on him and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags holding me with one hand meantime to prevent me summoning joseph. he exerted preterhuman selfdenial in abstaining from finishing him completely but getting out of breath he finally desisted and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. there he tore off the sleeve of earnshaws coat and bound up the wound with brutal roughness spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before. being at liberty i lost no time in seeking the old servant who having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale hurried below gasping as he descended the steps two at once.  what is ther to do now what is ther to do now  theres this to do thundered heathcliff that your masters mad and should he last another month ill have him to an asylum. and how the devil did you come to fasten me out you toothless hound dont stand muttering and mumbling there. come im not going to nurse him. wash that stuff away and mind the sparks of your candleit is more than half brandy  and so yeve been murthering on him exclaimed joseph lifting his hands and eyes in horror. if iver i seed a seeght loike this may the lord  heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood and flung a towel to him but instead of proceeding to dry it up he joined his hands and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology. i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing in fact i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows.  oh i forgot you said the tyrant. you shall do that. down with you. and you conspire with him against me do you viper there that is work fit for you  he shook me till my teeth rattled and pitched me beside joseph who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose vowing he would set off for the grange directly. mr. linton was a magistrate and though he had fifty wives dead he should inquire into this. he was so obstinate in his resolution that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place standing over me heaving with malevolence as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions. it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that heathcliff was not the aggressor especially with my hardlywrung replies. however mr. earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness. heathcliff aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible called him deliriously intoxicated and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further but advised him to get to bed. to my joy he left us after giving this judicious counsel and hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone. i departed to my own room marvelling that i had escaped so easily.  this morning when i came down about half an hour before noon mr. earnshaw was sitting by the fire deadly sick his evil genius almost as gaunt and ghastly leant against the chimney. neither appeared inclined to dine and having waited till all was cold on the table i commenced alone. nothing hindered me from eating heartily and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as at intervals i cast a look towards my silent companions and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me. after i had done i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire going round earnshaws seat and kneeling in the corner beside him.  heathcliff did not glance my way and i gazed up and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. his forehead that i once thought so manly and that i now think so diabolical was shaded with a heavy cloud his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness and weeping perhaps for the lashes were wet then his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness. had it been another i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief. in his case i was gratified and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy i couldnt miss this chance of sticking in a dart his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.  fie fie miss i interrupted. one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life. if god afflict your enemies surely that ought to suffice you. it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his  in general ill allow that it would be ellen she continued but what misery laid on heathcliff could content me unless i have a hand in it id rather he suffered less if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause. oh i owe him so much. on only one condition can i hope to forgive him. it is if i may take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth for every wrench of agony return a wrench reduce him to my level. as he was the first to injure make him the first to implore pardon and thenwhy then ellen i might show you some generosity. but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged and therefore i cannot forgive him. hindley wanted some water and i handed him a glass and asked him how he was.  not as ill as i wish he replied. but leaving out my arm every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps  yes no wonder was my next remark. catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her. its well people dont really rise from their grave or last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene are not you bruised and cut over your chest and shoulders  i cant say he answered but what do you mean did he dare to strike me when i was down  he trampled on and kicked you and dashed you on the ground i whispered. and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth because hes only half man not so much and the rest fiend.  mr. earnshaw looked up like me to the countenance of our mutual foe who absorbed in his anguish seemed insensible to anything around him the longer he stood the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.  oh if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony id go to hell with joy groaned the impatient man writhing to rise and sinking back in despair convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle.  nay its enough that he has murdered one of you i observed aloud. at the grange every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr. heathcliff. after all it is preferable to be hated than loved by him. when i recollect how happy we werehow happy catherine was before he cameim fit to curse the day.  most likely heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said than the spirit of the person who said it. his attention was roused i saw for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs. i stared full at him and laughed scornfully. the clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me the fiend which usually looked out however was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.  get up and begone out of my sight said the mourner.  i guessed he uttered those words at least though his voice was hardly intelligible.  i beg your pardon i replied. but i loved catherine too and her brother requires attendance which for her sake i shall supply. now that shes dead i see her in hindley hindley has exactly her eyes if you had not tried to gouge them out and made them black and red and her  get up wretched idiot before i stamp you to death he cried making a movement that caused me to make one also.  but then i continued holding myself ready to flee if poor catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous contemptible degrading title of mrs. heathcliff she would soon have presented a similar picture she wouldnt have borne your abominable behaviour quietly her detestation and disgust must have found voice.  the back of the settle and earnshaws person interposed between me and him so instead of endeavouring to reach me he snatched a dinnerknife from the table and flung it at my head. it struck beneath my ear and stopped the sentence i was uttering but pulling it out i sprang to the door and delivered another which i hope went a little deeper than his missile. the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part checked by the embrace of his host and both fell locked together on the hearth. in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway and blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory i bounded leaped and flew down the steep road then quitting its windings shot direct across the moor rolling over banks and wading through marshes precipitating myself in fact towards the beaconlight of the grange. and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than even for one night abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again.  isabella ceased speaking and took a drink of tea then she rose and bidding me put on her bonnet and a great shawl i had brought and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour she stepped on to a chair kissed edgars and catherines portraits bestowed a similar salute on me and descended to the carriage accompanied by fanny who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress. she was driven away never to revisit this neighbourhood but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled. i believe her new abode was in the south near london there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape. he was christened linton and from the first she reported him to be an ailing peevish creature.  mr. heathcliff meeting me one day in the village inquired where she lived. i refused to tell. he remarked that it was not of any moment only she must beware of coming to her brother she should not be with him if he had to keep her himself. though i would give no information he discovered through some of the other servants both her place of residence and the existence of the child. still he didnt molest her for which forbearance she might thank his aversion i suppose. he often asked about the infant when he saw me and on hearing its name smiled grimly and observed they wish me to hate it too do they  i dont think they wish you to know anything about it i answered.  but ill have it he said when i want it. they may reckon on that  fortunately its mother died before the time arrived some thirteen years after the decease of catherine when linton was twelve or a little more.  on the day succeeding isabellas unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master he shunned conversation and was fit for discussing nothing. when i could get him to listen i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow. so deep and sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of heathcliff. grief and that together transformed him into a complete hermit he threw up his office of magistrate ceased even to attend church avoided the village on all occasions and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds only varied by solitary rambles on the moors and visits to the grave of his wife mostly at evening or early morning before other wanderers were abroad. but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long. he didnt pray for catherines soul to haunt him. time brought resignation and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. he recalled her memory with ardent tender love and hopeful aspiring to the better world where he doubted not she was gone.  and he had earthly consolation and affections also. for a few days i said he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed that coldness melted as fast as snow in april and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despots sceptre in his heart. it was named catherine but he never called it the name in full as he had never called the first catherine short probably because heathcliff had a habit of doing so. the little one was always cathy it formed to him a distinction from the mother and yet a connection with her and his attachment sprang from its relation to her far more than from its being his own.  i used to draw a comparison between him and hindley earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances. they had both been fond husbands and were both attached to their children and i could not see how they shouldnt both have taken the same road for good or evil. but i thought in my mind hindley with apparently the stronger head has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. when his ship struck the captain abandoned his post and the crew instead of trying to save her rushed into riot and confusion leaving no hope for their luckless vessel. linton on the contrary displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul he trusted god and god comforted him. one hoped and the other despaired they chose their own lots and were righteously doomed to endure them. but youll not want to hear my moralising mr. lockwood youll judge as well as i can all these things at least youll think you will and thats the same. the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected it followed fast on his sisters there were scarcely six months between them. we at the grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral. mr. kenneth came to announce the event to my master.  well nelly said he riding into the yard one morning too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news its yours and my turn to go into mourning at present. whos given us the slip now do you think  who i asked in a flurry.  why guess he returned dismounting and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door. and nip up the corner of your apron im certain youll need it.  not mr. heathcliff surely i exclaimed.  what would you have tears for him said the doctor. no heathcliffs a tough young fellow he looks blooming today. ive just seen him. hes rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.  who is it then mr. kenneth i repeated impatiently.  hindley earnshaw your old friend hindley he replied and my wicked gossip though hes been too wild for me this long while. there i said we should draw water. but cheer up he died true to his character drunk as a lord. poor lad im sorry too. one cant help missing an old companion though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined and has done me many a rascally turn. hes barely twentyseven it seems thats your own age who would have thought you were born in one year  i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs. lintons death ancient associations lingered round my heart i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation desiring mr. kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master. i could not hinder myself from pondering on the questionhad he had fair play whatever i did that idea would bother me it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights and assist in the last duties to the dead. mr. linton was extremely reluctant to consent but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay and i said my old master and fosterbrother had a claim on my services as strong as his own. besides i reminded him that the child hareton was his wifes nephew and in the absence of nearer kin he ought to act as its guardian and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left and look over the concerns of his brotherinlaw. he was unfit for attending to such matters then but he bid me speak to his lawyer and at length permitted me to go. his lawyer had been earnshaws also i called at the village and asked him to accompany me. he shook his head and advised that heathcliff should be let alone affirming if the truth were known hareton would be found little else than a beggar.  his father died in debt he said the whole property is mortgaged and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditors heart that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.  when i reached the heights i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently and joseph who appeared in sufficient distress expressed satisfaction at my presence. mr. heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral if i chose.  correctly he remarked that fools body should be buried at the crossroads without ceremony of any kind. i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately we broke in this morning for we heard him snorting like a horse and there he was laid over the settle flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. i sent for kenneth and he came but not till the beast had changed into carrion he was both dead and cold and stark and so youll allow it was useless making more stir about him  the old servant confirmed this statement but muttered  id rayther hed goan hisseln for t doctor i sud ha taen tent o t maister better nor himand he warnt deead when i left naught o t soart  i insisted on the funeral being respectable. mr. heathcliff said i might have my own way there too only he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. he maintained a hard careless deportment indicative of neither joy nor sorrow if anything it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. i observed once indeed something like exultation in his aspect it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house. he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner and previous to following with hareton he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered with peculiar gusto now my bonny lad you are mine and well see if one tree wont grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech he played with heathcliffs whiskers and stroked his cheek but i divined its meaning and observed tartly that boy must go back with me to thrushcross grange sir. there is nothing in the world less yours than he is  does linton say so he demanded.  of coursehe has ordered me to take him i replied.  well said the scoundrel well not argue the subject now but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own if he attempt to remove it. i dont engage to let hareton go undisputed but ill be pretty sure to make the other come remember to tell him.  this hint was enough to bind our hands. i repeated its substance on my return and edgar linton little interested at the commencement spoke no more of interfering. im not aware that he could have done it to any purpose had he been ever so willing.  the guest was now the master of wuthering heights he held firm possession and proved to the attorneywho in his turn proved it to mr. lintonthat earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming and he heathcliff was the mortgagee. in that manner hareton who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his fathers inveterate enemy and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages quite unable to right himself because of his friendlessness and his ignorance that he has been wronged.     chapter xviii   the twelve years continued mrs. dean following that dismal period were the happiest of my life my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little ladys trifling illnesses which she had to experience in common with all children rich and poor. for the rest after the first six months she grew like a larch and could walk and talk too in her own way before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs. lintons dust. she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house a real beauty in face with the earnshaws handsome dark eyes but the lintons fair skin and small features and yellow curling hair. her spirit was high though not rough and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections. that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother still she did not resemble her for she could be soft and mild as a dove and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression her anger was never furious her love never fierce it was deep and tender. however it must be acknowledged she had faults to foil her gifts. a propensity to be saucy was one and a perverse will that indulged children invariably acquire whether they be good tempered or cross. if a servant chanced to vex her it was alwaysi shall tell papa and if he reproved her even by a look you would have thought it a heartbreaking business i dont believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her. he took her education entirely on himself and made it an amusement. fortunately curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar she learned rapidly and eagerly and did honour to his teaching.  till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself. mr. linton would take her with him a mile or so outside on rare occasions but he trusted her to no one else. gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears the chapel the only building she had approached or entered except her own home. wuthering heights and mr. heathcliff did not exist for her she was a perfect recluse and apparently perfectly contented. sometimes indeed while surveying the country from her nursery window she would observe  ellen how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills i wonder what lies on the other sideis it the sea  no miss cathy i would answer it is hills again just like these.  and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them she once asked.  the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. i explained that they were bare masses of stone with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.  and why are they bright so long after it is evening here she pursued.  because they are a great deal higher up than we are replied i you could not climb them they are too high and steep. in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the northeast side  oh you have been on them she cried gleefully. then i can go too when i am a woman. has papa been ellen  papa would tell you miss i answered hastily that they are not worth the trouble of visiting. the moors where you ramble with him are much nicer and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world.  but i know the park and i dont know those she murmured to herself. and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point my little pony minny shall take me some time.  one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project she teased mr. linton about it and he promised she should have the journey when she got older. but miss catherine measured her age by months and now am i old enough to go to penistone crags was the constant question in her mouth. the road thither wound close by wuthering heights. edgar had not the heart to pass it so she received as constantly the answer not yet love not yet.  i said mrs. heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband. her family were of a delicate constitution she and edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts. what her last illness was i am not certain i conjecture they died of the same thing a kind of fever slow at its commencement but incurable and rapidly consuming life towards the close. she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a fourmonths indisposition under which she had suffered and entreated him to come to her if possible for she had much to settle and she wished to bid him adieu and deliver linton safely into his hands. her hope was that linton might be left with him as he had been with her his father she would fain convince herself had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education. my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls he flew to answer this commending catherine to my peculiar vigilance in his absence with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.  he was away three weeks. the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library too sad for either reading or playing in that quiet state she caused me little trouble but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful weariness and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself. i used to send her on her travels round the groundsnow on foot and now on a pony indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.  the summer shone in full prime and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales. i did not fear her breaking bounds because the gates were generally locked and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone if they had stood wide open. unluckily my confidence proved misplaced. catherine came to me one morning at eight oclock and said she was that day an arabian merchant going to cross the desert with his caravan and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts a horse and three camels personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers. i got together good store of dainties and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle and she sprang up as gay as a fairy sheltered by her widebrimmed hat and gauze veil from the july sun and trotted off with a merry laugh mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back early. the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea. one traveller the hound being an old dog and fond of its ease returned but neither cathy nor the pony nor the two pointers were visible in any direction i despatched emissaries down this path and that path and at last went wandering in search of her myself. there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation on the borders of the grounds. i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.  i saw her at morn he replied she would have me to cut her a hazel switch and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder where it is lowest and galloped out of sight.  you may guess how i felt at hearing this news. it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags. what will become of her i ejaculated pushing through a gap which the man was repairing and making straight to the highroad. i walked as if for a wager mile after mile till a turn brought me in view of the heights but no catherine could i detect far or near. the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr. heathcliffs place and that is four from the grange so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them. and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them i reflected and been killed or broken some of her bones my suspense was truly painful and at first it gave me delightful relief to observe in hurrying by the farmhouse charlie the fiercest of the pointers lying under a window with swelled head and bleeding ear. i opened the wicket and ran to the door knocking vehemently for admittance. a woman whom i knew and who formerly lived at gimmerton answered she had been servant there since the death of mr. earnshaw.  ah said she you are come aseeking your little mistress dont be frightened. shes here safe but im glad it isnt the master.  he is not at home then is he i panted quite breathless with quick walking and alarm.  no no she replied both he and joseph are off and i think they wont return this hour or more. step in and rest you a bit.  i entered and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mothers when a child. her hat was hung against the wall and she seemed perfectly at home laughing and chattering in the best spirits imaginable to haretonnow a great strong lad of eighteenwho stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.  very well miss i exclaimed concealing my joy under an angry countenance. this is your last ride till papa comes back. ill not trust you over the threshold again you naughty naughty girl  aha ellen she cried gaily jumping up and running to my side. i shall have a pretty story to tell tonight and so youve found me out. have you ever been here in your life before  put that hat on and home at once said i. im dreadfully grieved at you miss cathy youve done extremely wrong its no use pouting and crying that wont repay the trouble ive had scouring the country after you. to think how mr. linton charged me to keep you in and you stealing off so it shows you are a cunning little fox and nobody will put faith in you any more.  what have i done sobbed she instantly checked. papa charged me nothing hell not scold me ellenhes never cross like you  come come i repeated. ill tie the riband. now let us have no petulance. oh for shame you thirteen years old and such a baby  this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.  nay said the servant dont be hard on the bonny lass mrs. dean. we made her stop shed fain have ridden forwards afeard you should be uneasy. hareton offered to go with her and i thought he should its a wild road over the hills.  hareton during the discussion stood with his hands in his pockets too awkward to speak though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.  how long am i to wait i continued disregarding the womans interference. it will be dark in ten minutes. where is the pony miss cathy and where is phoenix i shall leave you unless you be quick so please yourself.  the pony is in the yard she replied and phoenix is shut in there. hes bittenand so is charlie. i was going to tell you all about it but you are in a bad temper and dont deserve to hear.  i picked up her hat and approached to reinstate it but perceiving that the people of the house took her part she commenced capering round the room and on my giving chase ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue. hareton and the woman laughed and she joined them and waxed more impertinent still till i cried in great irritationwell miss cathy if you were aware whose house this is youd be glad enough to get out.  its your fathers isnt it said she turning to hareton.  nay he replied looking down and blushing bashfully.  he could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes though they were just his own.  whose thenyour masters she asked.  he coloured deeper with a different feeling muttered an oath and turned away.  who is his master continued the tiresome girl appealing to me. he talked about our house and our folk. i thought he had been the owners son. and he never said miss he should have done shouldnt he if hes a servant  hareton grew black as a thundercloud at this childish speech. i silently shook my questioner and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure.  now get my horse she said addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stableboys at the grange. and you may come with me. i want to see where the goblinhunter rises in the marsh and to hear about the fairishes as you call them but make haste whats the matter get my horse i say.  ill see thee damned before i be thy servant growled the lad.  youll see me what asked catherine in surprise.  damnedthou saucy witch he replied.  there miss cathy you see you have got into pretty company i interposed. nice words to be used to a young lady pray dont begin to dispute with him. come let us seek for minny ourselves and begone.  but ellen cried she staring fixed in astonishment how dare he speak so to me mustnt he be made to do as i ask him you wicked creature i shall tell papa what you said.now then  hareton did not appear to feel this threat so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation. you bring the pony she exclaimed turning to the woman and let my dog free this moment  softly miss answered the addressed. youll lose nothing by being civil. though mr. hareton there be not the masters son hes your cousin and i was never hired to serve you.  he my cousin cried cathy with a scornful laugh.  yes indeed responded her reprover.  oh ellen dont let them say such things she pursued in great trouble. papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london my cousin is a gentlemans son. that my she stopped and wept outright upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.  hush hush i whispered people can have many cousins and of all sorts miss cathy without being any the worse for it only they neednt keep their company if they be disagreeable and bad.  hes nothes not my cousin ellen she went on gathering fresh grief from reflection and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.  i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations having no doubt of lintons approaching arrival communicated by the former being reported to mr. heathcliff and feeling as confident that catherines first thought on her fathers return would be to seek an explanation of the latters assertion concerning her rudebred kindred. hareton recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant seemed moved by her distress and having fetched the pony round to the door he took to propitiate her a fine crookedlegged terrier whelp from the kennel and putting it into her hand bid her whist for he meant nought. pausing in her lamentations she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror then burst forth anew.  i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow who was a wellmade athletic youth goodlooking in features and stout and healthy but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game. still i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds to be sure whose rankness far overtopped their neglected growth yet notwithstanding evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances. mr. heathcliff i believe had not treated him physically ill thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to illtreatment in heathcliffs judgment. he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute he was never taught to read or write never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper never led a single step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice. and from what i heard joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a narrowminded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him as a boy because he was the head of the old family. and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine earnshaw and heathcliff when children of putting the master past his patience and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offald ways so at present he laid the whole burden of haretons faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property. if the lad swore he wouldnt correct him nor however culpably he behaved. it gave joseph satisfaction apparently to watch him go the worst lengths he allowed that the lad was ruined that his soul was abandoned to perdition but then he reflected that heathcliff must answer for it. haretons blood would be required at his hands and there lay immense consolation in that thought. joseph had instilled into him a pride of name and of his lineage he would had he dared have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations. i dont pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights i only speak from hearsay for i saw little. the villagers affirmed mr. heathcliff was near and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants but the house inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management and the scenes of riot common in hindleys time were not now enacted within its walls. the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people good or bad and he is yet.  this however is not making progress with my story. miss cathy rejected the peaceoffering of the terrier and demanded her own dogs charlie and phoenix. they came limping and hanging their heads and we set out for home sadly out of sorts every one of us. i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day except that as i supposed the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse when hareton happened to issue forth attended by some canine followers who attacked her train. they had a smart battle before their owners could separate them that formed an introduction. catherine told hareton who she was and where she was going and asked him to show her the way finally beguiling him to accompany her. he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave and twenty other queer places. but being in disgrace i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw. i could gather however that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant and heathcliffs housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart she who was always love and darling and queen and angel with everybody at the grange to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger she did not comprehend it and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father. i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights and how sorry he would be to find she had been there but i insisted most on the fact that if she revealed my negligence of his orders he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave and cathy couldnt bear that prospect she pledged her word and kept it for my sake. after all she was a sweet little girl.     chapter xix   a letter edged with black announced the day of my masters return. isabella was dead and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter and arrange a room and other accommodations for his youthful nephew. catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her real cousin. the evening of their expected arrival came. since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs and now attired in her new black frockpoor thing her aunts death impressed her with no definite sorrowshe obliged me by constant worrying to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.  linton is just six months younger than i am she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf under shadow of the trees. how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow aunt isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair it was lighter than minemore flaxen and quite as fine. i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box and ive often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner. oh i am happyand papa dear dear papa come ellen let us run come run.  she ran and returned and ran again many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path and tried to wait patiently but that was impossible she couldnt be still a minute.  how long they are she exclaimed. ah i see some dust on the roadthey are coming no when will they be here may we not go a little wayhalf a mile ellen only just half a mile do say yes to that clump of birches at the turn  i refused staunchly. at length her suspense was ended the travelling carriage rolled in sight. miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her fathers face looking from the window. he descended nearly as eager as herself and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton. he was asleep in a corner wrapped in a warm furlined cloak as if it had been winter. a pale delicate effeminate boy who might have been taken for my masters younger brother so strong was the resemblance but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had. the latter saw me looking and having shaken hands advised me to close the door and leave him undisturbed for the journey had fatigued him. cathy would fain have taken one glance but her father told her to come and they walked together up the park while i hastened before to prepare the servants.  now darling said mr. linton addressing his daughter as they halted at the bottom of the front steps your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are and he has lost his mother remember a very short time since therefore dont expect him to play and run about with you directly. and dont harass him much by talking let him be quiet this evening at least will you  yes yes papa answered catherine but i do want to see him and he hasnt once looked out.  the carriage stopped and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his uncle.  this is your cousin cathy linton he said putting their little hands together. shes fond of you already and mind you dont grieve her by crying tonight. try to be cheerful now the travelling is at an end and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.  let me go to bed then answered the boy shrinking from catherines salute and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.  come come theres a good child i whispered leading him in. youll make her weep toosee how sorry she is for you  i do not know whether it was sorrow for him but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself and returned to her father. all three entered and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready. i proceeded to remove lintons cap and mantle and placed him on a chair by the table but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh. my master inquired what was the matter.  i cant sit on a chair sobbed the boy.  go to the sofa then and ellen shall bring you some tea answered his uncle patiently.  he had been greatly tried during the journey i felt convinced by his fretful ailing charge. linton slowly trailed himself off and lay down. cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. at first she sat silent but that could not last she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin as she would have him to be and she commenced stroking his curls and kissing his cheek and offering him tea in her saucer like a baby. this pleased him for he was not much better he dried his eyes and lightened into a faint smile.  oh hell do very well said the master to me after watching them a minute. very well if we can keep him ellen. the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon and by wishing for strength hell gain it.  ay if we can keep him i mused to myself and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that. and then i thought how ever will that weakling live at wuthering heights between his father and hareton what playmates and instructors theyll be. our doubts were presently decidedeven earlier than i expected. i had just taken the children upstairs after tea was finished and seen linton asleephe would not suffer me to leave him till that was the casei had come down and was standing by the table in the hall lighting a bedroom candle for mr. edgar when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr. heathcliffs servant joseph was at the door and wished to speak with the master.  i shall ask him what he wants first i said in considerable trepidation. a very unlikely hour to be troubling people and the instant they have returned from a long journey. i dont think the master can see him.  joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words and now presented himself in the hall. he was donned in his sunday garments with his most sanctimonious and sourest face and holding his hat in one hand and his stick in the other he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.  goodevening joseph i said coldly. what business brings you here tonight  its maister linton i mun spake to he answered waving me disdainfully aside.  mr. linton is going to bed unless you have something particular to say im sure he wont hear it now i continued. you had better sit down in there and entrust your message to me.  which is his rahm pursued the fellow surveying the range of closed doors.  i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation so very reluctantly i went up to the library and announced the unseasonable visitor advising that he should be dismissed till next day. mr. linton had no time to empower me to do so for joseph mounted close at my heels and pushing into the apartment planted himself at the far side of the table with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick and began in an elevated tone as if anticipating opposition  hathecliff has sent me for his lad and i munnt goa back bout him.  edgar linton was silent a minute an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features he would have pitied the child on his own account but recalling isabellas hopes and fears and anxious wishes for her son and her commendations of him to his care he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up and searched in his heart how it might be avoided. no plan offered itself the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory there was nothing left but to resign him. however he was not going to rouse him from his sleep.  tell mr. heathcliff he answered calmly that his son shall come to wuthering heights tomorrow. he is in bed and too tired to go the distance now. you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired him to remain under my guardianship and at present his health is very precarious.  noa said joseph giving a thud with his prop on the floor and assuming an authoritative air. noa that means naught. hathecliff maks noa count o t mother nor ye norther but hell hev his lad und i mun tak himsoa now ye knaw  you shall not tonight answered linton decisively. walk down stairs at once and repeat to your master what i have said. ellen show him down. go  and aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm he rid the room of him and closed the door.  varrah weell shouted joseph as he slowly drew off. tomorn hes come hisseln and thrust him out if ye darr     chapter xx   to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr. linton commissioned me to take the boy home early on catherines pony and said heas we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights. merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us.  linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five oclock and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr. heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.  my father he cried in strange perplexity. mamma never told me i had a father. where does he live id rather stay with uncle.  he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty. and you should be glad to go home and to see him. you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you.  but why have i not heard of him before asked linton. why didnt mamma and he live together as other people do  he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your mothers health required her to reside in the south.  and why didnt mamma speak to me about him persevered the child. she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago. how am i to love papa i dont know him.  oh all children love their parents i said. your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you. let us make haste. an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hours more sleep.  is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday  not now replied i.  is uncle he continued.  no i shall be your companion there i said.  linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.  i wont go without uncle he cried at length i cant tell where you mean to take me.  i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my masters assistance in coaxing him out of bed. the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr. edgar and cathy would visit him and other promises equally illfounded which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. the pure heatherscented air the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while. he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness.  is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.  it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for youfresher and drier. you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood. and you will have such nice rambles on the moors. hareton earnshawthat is miss cathys other cousin and so yours in a mannerwill show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills.  and what is my father like he asked. is he as young and handsome as uncle  hes as young said i but he has black hair and eyes and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether. hell not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally hell be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own.  black hair and eyes mused linton. i cant fancy him. then i am not like him am i  not much i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eyeshis mothers eyes save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.  how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me he murmured. has he ever seen me if he has i must have been a baby. i remember not a single thing about him  why master linton said i three hundred miles is a great distance and ten years seem very different in length to a grownup person compared with what they do to you. it is probable mr. heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late. dont trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good.  the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse gardengate. i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance. he surveyed the carved front and lowbrowed lattices the straggling gooseberrybushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode. but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within. before he dismounted i went and opened the door. it was halfpast six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table. joseph stood by his masters chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton was preparing for the hayfield.  hallo nelly said mr. heathcliff when he saw me. i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself. youve brought it have you let us see what we can make of it.  he got up and strode to the door hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity. poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.  surely said joseph after a grave inspection hes swopped wi ye maister an yons his lass  heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh.  god what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed. havnt they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly oh damn my soul but thats worse than i expectedand the devil knows i was not sanguine  i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter. he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his fathers speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father. but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr. heathcliffs taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.  tut tut said heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin. none of that nonsense were not going to hurt thee lintonisnt that thy name thou art thy mothers child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken  he took off the boys cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination linton ceased crying and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.  do you know me asked heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble.  no said linton with a gaze of vacant fear.  youve heard of me i daresay  no he replied again.  no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me you are my son then ill tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. now dont wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood. be a good lad and ill do for you. nelly if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again. i guess youll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing wont be settled while you linger about it.  well replied i i hope youll be kind to the boy mr. heathcliff or youll not keep him long and hes all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever knowremember.  ill be very kind to him you neednt fear he said laughing. only nobody else must be kind to him im jealous of monopolising his affection. and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast. hareton you infernal calf begone to your work. yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor. besides hes mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their children to till their fathers lands for wages. that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives but that consideration is sufficient hes as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own. i have a room upstairs furnished for him in handsome style ive engaged a tutor also to come three times a week from twenty miles distance to teach him what he pleases to learn. ive ordered hareton to obey him and in fact ive arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates. i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and im bitterly disappointed with the wheyfaced whining wretch  while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milkporridge and placed it before linton who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it. i saw the old manservant shared largely in his masters scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.  cannot ate it repeated he peering in lintons face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard. but maister hareton nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what wer gooid eneugh for hims gooid eneugh for ye is rayther think  i shant eat it answered linton snappishly. take it away.  joseph snatched up the food indignantly and brought it to us.  is there aught ails th victuals he asked thrusting the tray under heathcliffs nose.  what should ail them he said.  wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em. but i guess its raight his mother wer just soawe wer amost too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead.  dont mention his mother to me said the master angrily. get him something that he can eat thats all. what is his usual food nelly  i suggested boiled milk or tea and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some. come i reflected his fathers selfishness may contribute to his comfort. he perceives his delicate constitution and the necessity of treating him tolerably. ill console mr. edgar by acquainting him with the turn heathcliffs humour has taken. having no excuse for lingering longer i slipped out while linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheepdog. but he was too much on the alert to be cheated as i closed the door i heard a cry and a frantic repetition of the words  dont leave me ill not stay here ill not stay here  then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth. i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended.     chapter xxi   we had sad work with little cathy that day she rose in high glee eager to join her cousin and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that edgar himself was obliged to soothe her by affirming he should come back soon he added however if i can get him and there were no hopes of that. this promise poorly pacified her but time was more potent and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when linton would return before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.  when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights in paying business visits to gimmerton i used to ask how the young master got on for he lived almost as secluded as catherine herself and was never to be seen. i could gather from her that he continued in weak health and was a tiresome inmate. she said mr. heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse though he took some trouble to conceal it he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together. there seldom passed much talk between them linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour or else lay in bed all day for he was constantly getting coughs and colds and aches and pains of some sort.  and i never knew such a fainthearted creature added the woman nor one so careful of hisseln. he will go on if i leave the window open a bit late in the evening. oh its killing a breath of night air and he must have a fire in the middle of summer and josephs baccapipe is poison and he must always have sweets and dainties and always milk milk for everheeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter and there hell sit wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at and if hareton for pity comes to amuse himhareton is not badnatured though hes roughtheyre sure to part one swearing and the other crying. i believe the master would relish earnshaws thrashing him to a mummy if he were not his son and im certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. but then he wont go into danger of temptation he never enters the parlour and should linton show those ways in the house where he is he sends him upstairs directly.  i divined from this account that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young heathcliff selfish and disagreeable if he were not so originally and my interest in him consequently decayed though still i was moved with a sense of grief at his lot and a wish that he had been left with us. mr. edgar encouraged me to gain information he thought a great deal about him i fancy and would have run some risk to see him and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village she said he had only been twice on horseback accompanying his father and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards. that housekeeper left if i recollect rightly two years after he came and another whom i did not know was her successor she lives there still.  time wore on at the grange in its former pleasant way till miss cathy reached sixteen. on the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing because it was also the anniversary of my late mistresss death. her father invariably spent that day alone in the library and walked at dusk as far as gimmerton kirkyard where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. therefore catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement. this twentieth of march was a beautiful spring day and when her father had retired my young lady came down dressed for going out and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me mr. linton had given her leave if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.  so make haste ellen she cried. i know where i wish to go where a colony of moorgame are settled i want to see whether they have made their nests yet.  that must be a good distance up i answered they dont breed on the edge of the moor.  no its not she said. ive gone very near with papa.  i put on my bonnet and sallied out thinking nothing more of the matter. she bounded before me and returned to my side and was off again like a young greyhound and at first i found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near and enjoying the sweet warm sunshine and watching her my pet and my delight with her golden ringlets flying loose behind and her bright cheek as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure. she was a happy creature and an angel in those days. its a pity she could not be content.  well said i where are your moorgame miss cathy we should be at them the grange parkfence is a great way off now.  oh a little furtheronly a little further ellen was her answer continually. climb to that hillock pass that bank and by the time you reach the other side i shall have raised the birds.  but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass that at length i began to be weary and told her we must halt and retrace our steps. i shouted to her as she had outstripped me a long way she either did not hear or did not regard for she still sprang on and i was compelled to follow. finally she dived into a hollow and before i came in sight of her again she was two miles nearer wuthering heights than her own home and i beheld a couple of persons arrest her one of whom i felt convinced was mr. heathcliff himself.  cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering or at least hunting out the nests of the grouse. the heights were heathcliffs land and he was reproving the poacher.  ive neither taken any nor found any she said as i toiled to them expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. i didnt mean to take them but papa told me there were quantities up here and i wished to see the eggs.  heathcliff glanced at me with an illmeaning smile expressing his acquaintance with the party and consequently his malevolence towards it and demanded who papa was  mr. linton of thrushcross grange she replied. i thought you did not know me or you wouldnt have spoken in that way.  you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected then he said sarcastically.  and what are you inquired catherine gazing curiously on the speaker. that man ive seen before. is he your son  she pointed to hareton the other individual who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.  miss cathy i interrupted it will be three hours instead of one that we are out presently. we really must go back.  no that man is not my son answered heathcliff pushing me aside. but i have one and you have seen him before too and though your nurse is in a hurry i think both you and she would be the better for a little rest. will you just turn this nab of heath and walk into my house youll get home earlier for the ease and you shall receive a kind welcome.  i whispered catherine that she mustnt on any account accede to the proposal it was entirely out of the question.  why she asked aloud. im tired of running and the ground is dewy i cant sit here. let us go ellen. besides he says i have seen his son. hes mistaken i think but i guess where he lives at the farmhouse i visited in coming from penistone crags. dont you  i do. come nelly hold your tongueit will be a treat for her to look in on us. hareton get forwards with the lass. you shall walk with me nelly.  no shes not going to any such place i cried struggling to release my arm which he had seized but she was almost at the doorstones already scampering round the brow at full speed. her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her he shied off by the roadside and vanished.  mr. heathcliff its very wrong i continued you know you mean no good. and there shell see linton and all will be told as soon as ever we return and i shall have the blame.  i want her to see linton he answered hes looking better these few days its not often hes fit to be seen. and well soon persuade her to keep the visit secret where is the harm of it  the harm of it is that her father would hate me if he found i suffered her to enter your house and i am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so i replied.  my design is as honest as possible. ill inform you of its whole scope he said. that the two cousins may fall in love and get married. im acting generously to your master his young chit has no expectations and should she second my wishes shell be provided for at once as joint successor with linton.  if linton died i answered and his life is quite uncertain catherine would be the heir.  no she would not he said. there is no clause in the will to secure it so his property would go to me but to prevent disputes i desire their union and am resolved to bring it about.  and im resolved she shall never approach your house with me again i returned as we reached the gate where miss cathy waited our coming.  heathcliff bade me be quiet and preceding us up the path hastened to open the door. my young lady gave him several looks as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him but now he smiled when he met her eye and softened his voice in addressing her and i was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury. linton stood on the hearth. he had been out walking in the fields for his cap was on and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry shoes. he had grown tall of his age still wanting some months of sixteen. his features were pretty yet and his eye and complexion brighter than i remembered them though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.  now who is that asked mr. heathcliff turning to cathy. can you tell  your son she said having doubtfully surveyed first one and then the other.  yes yes answered he but is this the only time you have beheld him think ah you have a short memory. linton dont you recall your cousin that you used to tease us so with wishing to see  what linton cried cathy kindling into joyful surprise at the name. is that little linton hes taller than i am are you linton  the youth stepped forward and acknowledged himself she kissed him fervently and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each. catherine had reached her full height her figure was both plump and slender elastic as steel and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits. lintons looks and movements were very languid and his form extremely slight but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects and rendered him not unpleasing. after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him his cousin went to mr. heathcliff who lingered by the door dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without pretending that is to observe the latter and really noting the former alone.  and you are my uncle then she cried reaching up to salute him. i thought i liked you though you were cross at first. why dont you visit at the grange with linton to live all these years such close neighbours and never see us is odd what have you done so for  i visited it once or twice too often before you were born he answered. theredamn it if you have any kisses to spare give them to linton they are thrown away on me.  naughty ellen exclaimed catherine flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses. wicked ellen to try to hinder me from entering. but ill take this walk every morning in future may i uncle and sometimes bring papa. wont you be glad to see us  of course replied the uncle with a hardly suppressed grimace resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. but stay he continued turning towards the young lady. now i think of it id better tell you. mr. linton has a prejudice against me we quarrelled at one time of our lives with unchristian ferocity and if you mention coming here to him hell put a veto on your visits altogether. therefore you must not mention it unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter you may come if you will but you must not mention it.  why did you quarrel asked catherine considerably crestfallen.  he thought me too poor to wed his sister answered heathcliff and was grieved that i got her his pride was hurt and hell never forgive it.  thats wrong said the young lady some time ill tell him so. but linton and i have no share in your quarrel. ill not come here then he shall come to the grange.  it will be too far for me murmured her cousin to walk four miles would kill me. no come here miss catherine now and then not every morning but once or twice a week.  the father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.  i am afraid nelly i shall lose my labour he muttered to me. miss catherine as the ninny calls her will discover his value and send him to the devil. now if it had been haretondo you know that twenty times a day i covet hareton with all his degradation id have loved the lad had he been some one else. but i think hes safe from her love. ill pit him against that paltry creature unless it bestir itself briskly. we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen. oh confound the vapid thing hes absorbed in drying his feet and never looks at her.linton  yes father answered the boy.  have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about not even a rabbit or a weasels nest take her into the garden before you change your shoes and into the stable to see your horse.  wouldnt you rather sit here asked linton addressing cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again.  i dont know she replied casting a longing look to the door and evidently eager to be active.  he kept his seat and shrank closer to the fire. heathcliff rose and went into the kitchen and from thence to the yard calling out for hareton. hareton responded and presently the two reentered. the young man had been washing himself as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair.  oh ill ask you uncle cried miss cathy recollecting the housekeepers assertion. that is not my cousin is he  yes he replied your mothers nephew. dont you like him  catherine looked queer.  is he not a handsome lad he continued.  the uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe and whispered a sentence in heathcliffs ear. he laughed hareton darkened i perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority. but his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming  youll be the favourite among us hareton she says you are awhat was it well something very flattering. here you go with her round the farm. and behave like a gentleman mind dont use any bad words and dont stare when the young lady is not looking at you and be ready to hide your face when she is and when you speak say your words slowly and keep your hands out of your pockets. be off and entertain her as nicely as you can.  he watched the couple walking past the window. earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion. he seemed studying the familiar landscape with a strangers and an artists interest. catherine took a sly look at him expressing small admiration. she then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself and tripped merrily on lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.  ive tied his tongue observed heathcliff. hell not venture a single syllable all the time nelly you recollect me at his agenay some years younger. did i ever look so stupid so gaumless as joseph calls it  worse i replied because more sullen with it.  ive a pleasure in him he continued reflecting aloud. he has satisfied my expectations. if he were a born fool i should not enjoy it half so much. but hes no fool and i can sympathise with all his feelings having felt them myself. i know what he suffers now for instance exactly it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer though. and hell never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance. ive got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me and lower for he takes a pride in his brutishness. ive taught him to scorn everything extraanimal as silly and weak. dont you think hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him almost as proud as i am of mine. but theres this difference one is gold put to the use of pavingstones and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver. mine has nothing valuable about it yet i shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. his had firstrate qualities and they are lost rendered worse than unavailing. i have nothing to regret he would have more than any but i are aware of. and the best of it is hareton is damnably fond of me youll own that ive outmatched hindley there. if the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offsprings wrongs i should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world  heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. i made no reply because i saw that he expected none. meantime our young companion who sat too removed from us to hear what was said began to evince symptoms of uneasiness probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of catherines society for fear of a little fatigue. his father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap.  get up you idle boy he exclaimed with assumed heartiness. away after them they are just at the corner by the stand of hives.  linton gathered his energies and left the hearth. the lattice was open and as he stepped out i heard cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door hareton stared up and scratched his head like a true clown.  its some damnable writing he answered. i cannot read it.  cant read it cried catherine i can read it its english. but i want to know why it is there.  linton giggled the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.  he does not know his letters he said to his cousin. could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce  is he all as he should be asked miss cathy seriously or is he simple not right ive questioned him twice now and each time he looked so stupid i think he does not understand me. i can hardly understand him im sure  linton repeated his laugh and glanced at hareton tauntingly who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.  theres nothing the matter but laziness is there earnshaw he said. my cousin fancies you are an idiot. there you experience the consequence of scorning booklarning as you would say. have you noticed catherine his frightful yorkshire pronunciation  why where the devil is the use ont growled hareton more ready in answering his daily companion. he was about to enlarge further but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement.  where is the use of the devil in that sentence tittered linton. papa told you not to say any bad words and you cant open your mouth without one. do try to behave like a gentleman now do  if thou werent more a lass than a lad id fell thee this minute i would pitiful lath of a crater retorted the angry boor retreating while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification for he was conscious of being insulted and embarrassed how to resent it.  mr. heathcliff having overheard the conversation as well as i smiled when he saw him go but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair who remained chattering in the doorway the boy finding animation enough while discussing haretons faults and deficiencies and relating anecdotes of his goings on and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings without considering the illnature they evinced. i began to dislike more than to compassionate linton and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.  we stayed till afternoon i could not tear miss cathy away sooner but happily my master had not quitted his apartment and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence. as we walked home i would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted but she got it into her head that i was prejudiced against them.  aha she cried you take papas side ellen you are partial i know or else you wouldnt have cheated me so many years into the notion that linton lived a long way from here. im really extremely angry only im so pleased i cant show it but you must hold your tongue about my uncle hes my uncle remember and ill scold papa for quarrelling with him.  and so she ran on till i relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake. she did not mention the visit that night because she did not see mr. linton. next day it all came out sadly to my chagrin and still i was not altogether sorry i thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. but he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the heights and catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.  papa she exclaimed after the mornings salutations guess whom i saw yesterday in my walk on the moors. ah papa you started youve not done right have you now i sawbut listen and you shall hear how i found you out and ellen who is in league with you and yet pretended to pity me so when i kept hoping and was always disappointed about lintons coming back  she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences and my master though he cast more than one reproachful look at me said nothing till she had concluded. then he drew her to him and asked if she knew why he had concealed lintons near neighbourhood from her could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy  it was because you disliked mr. heathcliff she answered.  then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours cathy he said. no it was not because i disliked mr. heathcliff but because mr. heathcliff dislikes me and is a most diabolical man delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates if they give him the slightest opportunity. i knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him and i knew he would detest you on my account so for your own good and nothing else i took precautions that you should not see linton again. i meant to explain this some time as you grew older and im sorry i delayed it.  but mr. heathcliff was quite cordial papa observed catherine not at all convinced and he didnt object to our seeing each other he said i might come to his house when i pleased only i must not tell you because you had quarrelled with him and would not forgive him for marrying aunt isabella. and you wont. you are the one to be blamed he is willing to let us be friends at least linton and i and you are not.  my master perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncleinlaws evil disposition gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to isabella and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property. he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic for though he spoke little of it he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs. lintons death. she might have been living yet if it had not been for him was his constant bitter reflection and in his eyes heathcliff seemed a murderer. miss cathyconversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience injustice and passion arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness and repented of on the day they were committedwas amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse. she appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human natureexcluded from all her studies and all her ideas till nowthat mr. edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. he merely added you will know hereafter darling why i wish you to avoid his house and family now return to your old employments and amusements and think no more about them.  catherine kissed her father and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours according to custom then she accompanied him into the grounds and the whole day passed as usual but in the evening when she had retired to her room and i went to help her to undress i found her crying on her knees by the bedside.  oh fie silly child i exclaimed. if you had any real griefs youd be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. you never had one shadow of substantial sorrow miss catherine. suppose for a minute that master and i were dead and you were by yourself in the world how would you feel then compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that and be thankful for the friends you have instead of coveting more.  im not crying for myself ellen she answered its for him. he expected to see me again tomorrow and there hell be so disappointed and hell wait for me and i shant come  nonsense said i do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him hasnt he hareton for a companion not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice for two afternoons. linton will conjecture how it is and trouble himself no further about you.  but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come she asked rising to her feet. and just send those books i promised to lend him his books are not as nice as mine and he wanted to have them extremely when i told him how interesting they were. may i not ellen  no indeed no indeed replied i with decision. then he would write to you and thered never be an end of it. no miss catherine the acquaintance must be dropped entirely so papa expects and i shall see that it is done.  but how can one little note she recommenced putting on an imploring countenance.  silence i interrupted. well not begin with your little notes. get into bed.  she threw at me a very naughty look so naughty that i would not kiss her goodnight at first i covered her up and shut her door in great displeasure but repenting halfway i returned softly and lo there was miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.  youll get nobody to take that catherine i said if you write it and at present i shall put out your candle.  i set the extinguisher on the flame receiving as i did so a slap on my hand and a petulant cross thing i then quitted her again and she drew the bolt in one of her worst most peevish humours. the letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milkfetcher who came from the village but that i didnt learn till some time afterwards. weeks passed on and cathy recovered her temper though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself and often if i came near her suddenly while reading she would start and bend over the book evidently desirous to hide it and i detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves. she also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen as if she were expecting the arrival of something and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which she would trifle over for hours and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.  one day as she inspected this drawer i observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper. my curiosity and suspicions were roused i determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures so at night as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs i searched and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. having opened i emptied the whole contents into my apron and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. though i could not but suspect i was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondencedaily almost it must have beenfrom linton heathcliff answers to documents forwarded by her. the earlier dated were embarrassed and short gradually however they expanded into copious loveletters foolish as the age of the writer rendered natural yet with touches here and there which i thought were borrowed from a more experienced source. some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness commencing in strong feeling and concluding in the affected wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied incorporeal sweetheart. whether they satisfied cathy i dont know but they appeared very worthless trash to me. after turning over as many as i thought proper i tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside relocking the vacant drawer.  following her habit my young lady descended early and visited the kitchen i watched her go to the door on the arrival of a certain little boy and while the dairymaid filled his can she tucked something into his jacket pocket and plucked something out. i went round by the garden and laid wait for the messenger who fought valorously to defend his trust and we spilt the milk between us but i succeeded in abstracting the epistle and threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home i remained under the wall and perused miss cathys affectionate composition. it was more simple and more eloquent than her cousins very pretty and very silly. i shook my head and went meditating into the house. the day being wet she could not divert herself with rambling about the park so at the conclusion of her morning studies she resorted to the solace of the drawer. her father sat reading at the table and i on purpose had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the windowcurtain keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brimful of chirping young ones express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings than she by her single oh and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance. mr. linton looked up.  what is the matter love have you hurt yourself he said.  his tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard.  no papa she gasped. ellen ellen come upstairsim sick  i obeyed her summons and accompanied her out.  oh ellen you have got them she commenced immediately dropping on her knees when we were enclosed alone. oh give them to me and ill never never do so again dont tell papa. you have not told papa ellen say you have not ive been exceedingly naughty but i wont do it any more  with a grave severity in my manner i bade her stand up.  so i exclaimed miss catherine you are tolerably far on it seems you may well be ashamed of them a fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours to be sure why its good enough to be printed and what do you suppose the master will think when i display it before him i havnt shown it yet but you neednt imagine i shall keep your ridiculous secrets. for shame and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities he would not have thought of beginning im certain.  i didnt i didnt sobbed cathy fit to break her heart. i didnt once think of loving him till  loving cried i as scornfully as i could utter the word. loving did anybody ever hear the like i might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. pretty loving indeed and both times together you have seen linton hardly four hours in your life now here is the babyish trash. im going with it to the library and well see what your father says to such loving.  she sprang at her precious epistles but i held them above my head and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn themdo anything rather than show them. and being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scoldfor i esteemed it all girlish vanityi at length relented in a measure and askedif i consent to burn them will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again nor a book for i perceive you have sent him books nor locks of hair nor rings nor playthings  we dont send playthings cried catherine her pride overcoming her shame.  nor anything at all then my lady i said. unless you will here i go.  i promise ellen she cried catching my dress. oh put them in the fire do do  but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne. she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her one or two.  one or two ellen to keep for lintons sake  i unknotted the handkerchief and commenced dropping them in from an angle and the flame curled up the chimney.  i will have one you cruel wretch she screamed darting her hand into the fire and drawing forth some halfconsumed fragments at the expense of her fingers.  very welland i will have some to exhibit to papa i answered shaking back the rest into the bundle and turning anew to the door.  she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames and motioned me to finish the immolation. it was done i stirred up the ashes and interred them under a shovelful of coals and she mutely and with a sense of intense injury retired to her private apartment. i descended to tell my master that the young ladys qualm of sickness was almost gone but i judged it best for her to lie down a while. she wouldnt dine but she reappeared at tea pale and red about the eyes and marvellously subdued in outward aspect. next morning i answered the letter by a slip of paper inscribed master heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to miss linton as she will not receive them. and thenceforth the little boy came with vacant pockets.     chapter xxii   summer drew to an end and early autumn it was past michaelmas but the harvest was late that year and a few of our fields were still uncleared. mr. linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk and the evening happening to be chill and damp my master caught a bad cold that settled obstinately on his lungs and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter nearly without intermission.  poor cathy frightened from her little romance had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment and her father insisted on her reading less and taking more exercise. she had his companionship no longer i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack as much as possible with mine an inefficient substitute for i could only spare two or three hours from my numerous diurnal occupations to follow her footsteps and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.  on an afternoon in october or the beginning of novembera fresh watery afternoon when the turf and paths were rustling with moist withered leaves and the cold blue sky was half hidden by cloudsdark grey streamers rapidly mounting from the west and boding abundant raini requested my young lady to forego her ramble because i was certain of showers. she refused and i unwillingly donned a cloak and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park a formal walk which she generally affected if lowspiritedand that she invariably was when mr. edgar had been worse than ordinary a thing never known from his confession but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. she went sadly on there was no running or bounding now though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race. and often from the side of my eye i could detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheek. i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. on one side of the road rose a high rough bank where hazels and stunted oaks with their roots half exposed held uncertain tenure the soil was too loose for the latter and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal. in summer miss catherine delighted to climb along these trunks and sit in the branches swinging twenty feet above the ground and i pleased with her agility and her light childish heart still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. from dinner to tea she would lie in her breezerocked cradle doing nothing except singing old songsmy nursery loreto herself or watching the birds joint tenants feed and entice their young ones to fly or nestling with closed lids half thinking half dreaming happier than words can express.  look miss i exclaimed pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree. winter is not here yet. theres a little flower up yonder the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist. will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa  cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter and replied at lengthno ill not touch it but it looks melancholy does it not ellen  yes i observed about as starved and sackless as you your cheeks are bloodless let us take hold of hands and run. youre so low i daresay i shall keep up with you.  no she repeated and continued sauntering on pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss or a tuft of blanched grass or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage and ever and anon her hand was lifted to her averted face.  catherine why are you crying love i asked approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder. you mustnt cry because papa has a cold be thankful it is nothing worse.  she now put no further restraint on her tears her breath was stifled by sobs.  oh it will be something worse she said. and what shall i do when papa and you leave me and i am by myself i cant forget your words ellen they are always in my ear. how life will be changed how dreary the world will be when papa and you are dead.  none can tell whether you wont die before us i replied. its wrong to anticipate evil. well hope there are years and years to come before any of us go master is young and i am strong and hardly fortyfive. my mother lived till eighty a canty dame to the last. and suppose mr. linton were spared till he saw sixty that would be more years than you have counted miss. and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand  but aunt isabella was younger than papa she remarked gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation.  aunt isabella had not you and me to nurse her i replied. she wasnt as happy as master she hadnt as much to live for. all you need do is to wait well on your father and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject mind that cathy ill not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless and cherished a foolish fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.  i fret about nothing on earth except papas illness answered my companion. i care for nothing in comparison with papa. and ill neverneveroh never while i have my senses do an act or say a word to vex him. i love him better than myself ellen and i know it by this i pray every night that i may live after him because i would rather be miserable than that he should be that proves i love him better than myself.  good words i replied. but deeds must prove it also and after he is well remember you dont forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.  as we talked we neared a door that opened on the road and my young lady lightening into sunshine again climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wildrose trees shadowing the highway side the lower fruit had disappeared but only birds could touch the upper except from cathys present station. in stretching to pull them her hat fell off and as the door was locked she proposed scrambling down to recover it. i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall and she nimbly disappeared. but the return was no such easy matter the stones were smooth and neatly cemented and the rosebushes and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in reascending. i like a fool didnt recollect that till i heard her laughing and exclaimingellen youll have to fetch the key or else i must run round to the porters lodge. i cant scale the ramparts on this side  stay where you are i answered i have my bundle of keys in my pocket perhaps i may manage to open it if not ill go.  catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door while i tried all the large keys in succession. i had applied the last and found that none would do so repeating my desire that she would remain there i was about to hurry home as fast as i could when an approaching sound arrested me. it was the trot of a horse cathys dance stopped also.  who is that i whispered.  ellen i wish you could open the door whispered back my companion anxiously.  ho miss linton cried a deep voice the riders im glad to meet you. dont be in haste to enter for i have an explanation to ask and obtain.  i shant speak to you mr. heathcliff answered catherine. papa says you are a wicked man and you hate both him and me and ellen says the same.  that is nothing to the purpose said heathcliff. he it was. i dont hate my son i suppose and it is concerning him that i demand your attention. yes you have cause to blush. two or three months since were you not in the habit of writing to linton making love in play eh you deserved both of you flogging for that you especially the elder and less sensitive as it turns out. ive got your letters and if you give me any pertness ill send them to your father. i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it didnt you well you dropped linton with it into a slough of despond. he was in earnest in love really. as true as i live hes dying for you breaking his heart at your fickleness not figuratively but actually. though hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks and i have used more serious measures and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy he gets worse daily and hell be under the sod before summer unless you restore him  how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child i called from the inside. pray ride on how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods miss cathy ill knock the lock off with a stone you wont believe that vile nonsense. you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.  i was not aware there were eavesdroppers muttered the detected villain. worthy mrs. dean i like you but i dont like your doubledealing he added aloud. how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the poor child and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my doorstones catherine linton the very name warms me my bonny lass i shall be from home all this week go and see if i have not spoken truth do theres a darling just imagine your father in my place and linton in yours then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you when your father himself entreated him and dont from pure stupidity fall into the same error. i swear on my salvation hes going to his grave and none but you can save him  the lock gave way and i issued out.  i swear linton is dying repeated heathcliff looking hard at me. and grief and disappointment are hastening his death. nelly if you wont let her go you can walk over yourself. but i shall not return till this time next week and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.  come in said i taking cathy by the arm and half forcing her to reenter for she lingered viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker too stern to express his inward deceit.  he pushed his horse close and bending down observed  miss catherine ill own to you that i have little patience with linton and hareton and joseph have less. ill own that hes with a harsh set. he pines for kindness as well as love and a kind word from you would be his best medicine. dont mind mrs. deans cruel cautions but be generous and contrive to see him. he dreams of you day and night and cannot be persuaded that you dont hate him since you neither write nor call.  i closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it and spreading my umbrella i drew my charge underneath for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees and warned us to avoid delay. our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with heathcliff as we stretched towards home but i divined instinctively that catherines heart was clouded now in double darkness. her features were so sad they did not seem hers she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.  the master had retired to rest before we came in. cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was he had fallen asleep. she returned and asked me to sit with her in the library. we took our tea together and afterwards she lay down on the rug and told me not to talk for she was weary. i got a book and pretended to read. as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her silent weeping it appeared at present her favourite diversion. i suffered her to enjoy it a while then i expostulated deriding and ridiculing all mr. heathcliffs assertions about his son as if i were certain she would coincide. alas i hadnt skill to counteract the effect his account had produced it was just what he intended.  you may be right ellen she answered but i shall never feel at ease till i know. and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i dont write and convince him that i shall not change.  what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity we parted that nighthostile but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights by the side of my wilful young mistresss pony. i couldnt bear to witness her sorrow to see her pale dejected countenance and heavy eyes and i yielded in the faint hope that linton himself might prove by his reception of us how little of the tale was founded on fact.     chapter xxiii   the rainy night had ushered in a misty morninghalf frost half drizzleand temporary brooks crossed our pathgurgling from the uplands. my feet were thoroughly wetted i was cross and low exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. we entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way to ascertain whether mr. heathcliff were really absent because i put slight faith in his own affirmation.  joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone beside a roaring fire a quart of ale on the table near him bristling with large pieces of toasted oatcake and his black short pipe in his mouth. catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself. i asked if the master was in my question remained so long unanswered that i thought the old man had grown deaf and repeated it louder.  naay he snarled or rather screamed through his nose. naay yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.  joseph cried a peevish voice simultaneously with me from the inner room. how often am i to call you there are only a few red ashes now. joseph come this moment.  vigorous puffs and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal. the housekeeper and hareton were invisible one gone on an errand and the other at his work probably. we knew lintons tones and entered.  oh i hope youll die in a garret starved to death said the boy mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.  he stopped on observing his error his cousin flew to him.  is that you miss linton he said raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he reclined. nodont kiss me it takes my breath. dear me papa said you would call continued he after recovering a little from catherines embrace while she stood by looking very contrite. will you shut the door if you please you left it open and thosethose detestable creatures wont bring coals to the fire. its so cold  i stirred up the cinders and fetched a scuttleful myself. the invalid complained of being covered with ashes but he had a tiresome cough and looked feverish and ill so i did not rebuke his temper.  well linton murmured catherine when his corrugated brow relaxed are you glad to see me can i do you any good  why didnt you come before he asked. you should have come instead of writing. it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. id far rather have talked to you. now i can neither bear to talk nor anything else. i wonder where zillah is will you looking at me step into the kitchen and see  i had received no thanks for my other service and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest i replied  nobody is out there but joseph.  i want to drink he exclaimed fretfully turning away. zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went its miserable and im obliged to come down herethey resolved never to hear me upstairs.  is your father attentive to you master heathcliff i asked perceiving catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.  attentive he makes them a little more attentive at least he cried. the wretches do you know miss linton that brute hareton laughs at me i hate him indeed i hate them all they are odious beings.  cathy began searching for some water she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser filled a tumbler and brought it. he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table and having swallowed a small portion appeared more tranquil and said she was very kind.  and are you glad to see me asked she reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.  yes i am. its something new to hear a voice like yours he replied. but i have been vexed because you wouldnt come. and papa swore it was owing to me he called me a pitiful shuffling worthless thing and said you despised me and if he had been in my place he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time. but you dont despise me do you miss  i wish you would say catherine or cathy interrupted my young lady. despise you no next to papa and ellen i love you better than anybody living. i dont love mr. heathcliff though and i dare not come when he returns will he stay away many days  not many answered linton but he goes on to the moors frequently since the shooting season commenced and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence. do say you will. i think i should not be peevish with you youd not provoke me and youd always be ready to help me wouldnt you  yes said catherine stroking his long soft hair if i could only get papas consent id spend half my time with you. pretty linton i wish you were my brother.  and then you would like me as well as your father observed he more cheerfully. but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my wife so id rather you were that.  no i should never love anybody better than papa she returned gravely. and people hate their wives sometimes but not their sisters and brothers and if you were the latter you would live with us and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.  linton denied that people ever hated their wives but cathy affirmed they did and in her wisdom instanced his own fathers aversion to her aunt. i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. i couldnt succeed till everything she knew was out. master heathcliff much irritated asserted her relation was false.  papa told me and papa does not tell falsehoods she answered pertly.  my papa scorns yours cried linton. he calls him a sneaking fool.  yours is a wicked man retorted catherine and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says. he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella leave him as she did.  she didnt leave him said the boy you shant contradict me.  she did cried my young lady.  well ill tell you something said linton. your mother hated your father now then.  oh exclaimed catherine too enraged to continue.  and she loved mine added he.  you little liar i hate you now she panted and her face grew red with passion.  she did she did sang linton sinking into the recess of his chair and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant who stood behind.  hush master heathcliff i said thats your fathers tale too i suppose.  it isnt you hold your tongue he answered. she did she did catherine she did she did  cathy beside herself gave the chair a violent push and caused him to fall against one arm. he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. it lasted so long that it frightened even me. as to his cousin she wept with all her might aghast at the mischief she had done though she said nothing. i held him till the fit exhausted itself. then he thrust me away and leant his head down silently. catherine quelled her lamentations also took a seat opposite and looked solemnly into the fire.  how do you feel now master heathcliff i inquired after waiting ten minutes.  i wish she felt as i do he replied spiteful cruel thing hareton never touches me he never struck me in his life. and i was better today and there his voice died in a whimper.  i didnt strike you muttered cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.  he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering and kept it up for a quarter of an hour on purpose to distress his cousin apparently for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice.  im sorry i hurt you linton she said at length racked beyond endurance. but i couldnt have been hurt by that little push and i had no idea that you could either youre not much are you linton dont let me go home thinking ive done you harm. answer speak to me.  i cant speak to you he murmured youve hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough. if you had it youd know what it was but youll be comfortably asleep while im in agony and nobody near me. i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights and he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself.  since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights i said it wont be miss who spoils your ease youd be the same had she never come. however she shall not disturb you again and perhaps youll get quieter when we leave you.  must i go asked catherine dolefully bending over him. do you want me to go linton  you cant alter what youve done he replied pettishly shrinking from her unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.  well then i must go she repeated.  let me alone at least said he i cant bear your talking.  she lingered and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while but as he neither looked up nor spoke she finally made a movement to the door and i followed. we were recalled by a scream. linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can. i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him. not so my companion she ran back in terror knelt down and cried and soothed and entreated till he grew quiet from lack of breath by no means from compunction at distressing her.  i shall lift him on to the settle i said and he may roll about as he pleases we cant stop to watch him. i hope you are satisfied miss cathy that you are not the person to benefit him and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. now then there he is come away as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense hell be glad to lie still.  she placed a cushion under his head and offered him some water he rejected the latter and tossed uneasily on the former as if it were a stone or a block of wood. she tried to put it more comfortably.  i cant do with that he said its not high enough.  catherine brought another to lay above it.  thats too high murmured the provoking thing.  how must i arrange it then she asked despairingly.  he twined himself up to her as she half knelt by the settle and converted her shoulder into a support.  no that wont do i said. youll be content with the cushion master heathcliff. miss has wasted too much time on you already we cannot remain five minutes longer.  yes yes we can replied cathy. hes good and patient now. hes beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will tonight if i believe he is the worse for my visit and then i dare not come again. tell the truth about it linton for i mustnt come if i have hurt you.  you must come to cure me he answered. you ought to come because you have hurt me you know you have extremely i was not as ill when you entered as i am at presentwas i  but youve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.i didnt do it all said his cousin. however well be friends now. and you want me you would wish to see me sometimes really  i told you i did he replied impatiently. sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee. thats as mamma used to do whole afternoons together. sit quite still and dont talk but you may sing a song if you can sing or you may say a nice long interesting balladone of those you promised to teach me or a story. id rather have a ballad though begin.  catherine repeated the longest she could remember. the employment pleased both mightily. linton would have another and after that another notwithstanding my strenuous objections and so they went on until the clock struck twelve and we heard hareton in the court returning for his dinner.  and tomorrow catherine will you be here tomorrow asked young heathcliff holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.  no i answered nor next day neither. she however gave a different response evidently for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear.  you wont go tomorrow recollect miss i commenced when we were out of the house. you are not dreaming of it are you  she smiled.  oh ill take good care i continued ill have that lock mended and you can escape by no way else.  i can get over the wall she said laughing. the grange is not a prison ellen and you are not my gaoler. and besides im almost seventeen im a woman. and im certain linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. im older than he is you know and wiser less childish am i not and hell soon do as i direct him with some slight coaxing. hes a pretty little darling when hes good. id make such a pet of him if he were mine. we should never quarrel should we after we were used to each other dont you like him ellen  like him i exclaimed. the worsttempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. happily as mr. heathcliff conjectured hell not win twenty. i doubt whether hell see spring indeed. and small loss to his family whenever he drops off. and lucky it is for us that his father took him the kinder he was treated the more tedious and selfish hed be. im glad you have no chance of having him for a husband miss catherine.  my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.  hes younger than i she answered after a protracted pause of meditation and he ought to live the longest he willhe must live as long as i do. hes as strong now as when he first came into the north im positive of that. its only a cold that ails him the same as papa has. you say papa will get better and why shouldnt he  well well i cried after all we neednt trouble ourselves for listen missand mind ill keep my wordif you attempt going to wuthering heights again with or without me i shall inform mr. linton and unless he allow it the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.  it has been revived muttered cathy sulkily.  must not be continued then i said.  well see was her reply and she set off at a gallop leaving me to toil in the rear.  we both reached home before our dinnertime my master supposed we had been wandering through the park and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence. as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings but sitting such a while at the heights had done the mischief. on the succeeding morning i was laid up and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties a calamity never experienced prior to that period and never i am thankful to say since.  my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my solitude the confinement brought me exceedingly low. it is wearisome to a stirring active body but few have slighter reasons for complaint than i had. the moment catherine left mr. lintons room she appeared at my bedside. her day was divided between us no amusement usurped a minute she neglected her meals her studies and her play and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. she must have had a warm heart when she loved her father so to give so much to me. i said her days were divided between us but the master retired early and i generally needed nothing after six oclock thus the evening was her own. poor thing i never considered what she did with herself after tea. and though frequently when she looked in to bid me goodnight i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.     chapter xxiv   at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house. and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine to read to me because my eyes were weak. we were in the library the master having gone to bed she consented rather unwillingly i fancied and imagining my sort of books did not suit her i bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused. she selected one of her own favourites and got forward steadily about an hour then came frequent questions.  ellen are not you tired hadnt you better lie down now youll be sick keeping up so long ellen.  no no dear im not tired i returned continually.  perceiving me immovable she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation. it changed to yawning and stretching and  ellen im tired.  give over then and talk i answered.  that was worse she fretted and sighed and looked at her watch till eight and finally went to her room completely overdone with sleep judging by her peevish heavy look and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes. the following night she seemed more impatient still and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache and left me. i thought her conduct odd and having remained alone a long while i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better and asking her to come and lie on the sofa instead of upstairs in the dark. no catherine could i discover upstairs and none below. the servants affirmed they had not seen her. i listened at mr. edgars door all was silence. i returned to her apartment extinguished my candle and seated myself in the window.  the moon shone bright a sprinkling of snow covered the ground and i reflected that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for refreshment. i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park but it was not my young mistress on its emerging into the light i recognised one of the grooms. he stood a considerable period viewing the carriageroad through the grounds then started off at a brisk pace as if he had detected something and reappeared presently leading misss pony and there she was just dismounted and walking by its side. the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable. cathy entered by the casementwindow of the drawingroom and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her. she put the door gently to slipped off her snowy shoes untied her hat and was proceeding unconscious of my espionage to lay aside her mantle when i suddenly rose and revealed myself. the surprise petrified her an instant she uttered an inarticulate exclamation and stood fixed.  my dear miss catherine i began too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold where have you been riding out at this hour and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale where have you been speak  to the bottom of the park she stammered. i didnt tell a tale.  and nowhere else i demanded.  no was the muttered reply.  oh catherine i cried sorrowfully. you know you have been doing wrong or you wouldnt be driven to uttering an untruth to me. that does grieve me. id rather be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie.  she sprang forward and bursting into tears threw her arms round my neck.  well ellen im so afraid of you being angry she said. promise not to be angry and you shall know the very truth i hate to hide it.  we sat down in the windowseat i assured her i would not scold whatever her secret might be and i guessed it of course so she commenced  ive been to wuthering heights ellen and ive never missed going a day since you fell ill except thrice before and twice after you left your room. i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening and to put her back in the stable you mustnt scold him either mind. i was at the heights by halfpast six and generally stayed till halfpast eight and then galloped home. it was not to amuse myself that i went i was often wretched all the time. now and then i was happy once in a week perhaps. at first i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to linton for i had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him but as you stayed upstairs on the morrow i escaped that trouble. while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon i got possession of the key and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him because he was sick and couldnt come to the grange and how papa would object to my going and then i negotiated with him about the pony. he is fond of reading and he thinks of leaving soon to get married so he offered if i would lend him books out of the library to do what i wished but i preferred giving him my own and that satisfied him better.  on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits and zillah that is their housekeeper made us a clean room and a good fire and told us that as joseph was out at a prayermeeting and hareton earnshaw was off with his dogsrobbing our woods of pheasants as i heard afterwardswe might do what we liked. she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread and appeared exceedingly goodnatured and linton sat in the armchair and i in the little rocking chair on the hearthstone and we laughed and talked so merrily and found so much to say we planned where we would go and what we would do in summer. i neednt repeat that because you would call it silly.  one time however we were near quarrelling. he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom and the larks singing high up overhead and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. that was his most perfect idea of heavens happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree with a west wind blowing and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks but throstles and blackbirds and linnets and cuckoos pouring out music on every side and the moors seen at a distance broken into cool dusky dells but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water and the whole world awake and wild with joy. he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. i said his heaven would be only half alive and he said mine would be drunk i said i should fall asleep in his and he said he could not breathe in mine and began to grow very snappish. at last we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came and then we kissed each other and were friends.  after sitting still an hour i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the table and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us and wed have a game at blindmansbuff she should try to catch us you used to you know ellen. he wouldnt there was no pleasure in it he said but he consented to play at ball with me. we found two in a cupboard among a heap of old toys tops and hoops and battledores and shuttlecocks. one was marked c. and the other h. i wished to have the c. because that stood for catherine and the h. might be for heathcliff his name but the bran came out of h. and linton didnt like it. i beat him constantly and he got cross again and coughed and returned to his chair. that night though he easily recovered his good humour he was charmed with two or three pretty songsyour songs ellen and when i was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following evening and i promised. minny and i went flying home as light as air and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning.  on the morrow i was sad partly because you were poorly and partly that i wished my father knew and approved of my excursions but it was beautiful moonlight after tea and as i rode on the gloom cleared. i shall have another happy evening i thought to myself and what delights me more my pretty linton will. i trotted up their garden and was turning round to the back when that fellow earnshaw met me took my bridle and bid me go in by the front entrance. he patted minnys neck and said she was a bonny beast and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him. i only told him to leave my horse alone or else it would kick him. he answered in his vulgar accent it wouldnt do mitch hurt if it did and surveyed its legs with a smile. i was half inclined to make it try however he moved off to open the door and as he raised the latch he looked up to the inscription above and said with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation miss catherine i can read yon now.  wonderful i exclaimed. pray let us hear youyou are grown clever  he spelt and drawled over by syllables the namehareton earnshaw.  and the figures i cried encouragingly perceiving that he came to a dead halt.  i cannot tell them yet he answered.  oh you dunce i said laughing heartily at his failure.  the fool stared with a grin hovering about his lips and a scowl gathering over his eyes as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth whether it were not pleasant familiarity or what it really was contempt. i settled his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away for i came to see linton not him. he reddenedi saw that by the moonlightdropped his hand from the latch and skulked off a picture of mortified vanity. he imagined himself to be as accomplished as linton i suppose because he could spell his own name and was marvellously discomfited that i didnt think the same.  stop miss catherine dear i interrupted. i shall not scold but i dont like your conduct there. if you had remembered that hareton was your cousin as much as master heathcliff you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way. at least it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton and probably he did not learn merely to show off you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before i have no doubt and he wished to remedy it and please you. to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. had you been brought up in his circumstances would you be less rude he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were and im hurt that he should be despised now because that base heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.  well ellen you wont cry about it will you she exclaimed surprised at my earnestness. but wait and you shall hear if he conned his a b c to please me and if it were worth while being civil to the brute. i entered linton was lying on the settle and half got up to welcome me.  im ill tonight catherine love he said and you must have all the talk and let me listen. come and sit by me. i was sure you wouldnt break your word and ill make you promise again before you go.  i knew now that i mustnt tease him as he was ill and i spoke softly and put no questions and avoided irritating him in any way. i had brought some of my nicest books for him he asked me to read a little of one and i was about to comply when earnshaw burst the door open having gathered venom with reflection. he advanced direct to us seized linton by the arm and swung him off the seat.  get to thy own room he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion and his face looked swelled and furious. take her there if she comes to see thee thou shallnt keep me out of this. begone wi ye both  he swore at us and left linton no time to answer nearly throwing him into the kitchen and he clenched his fist as i followed seemingly longing to knock me down. i was afraid for a moment and i let one volume fall he kicked it after me and shut us out. i heard a malignant crackly laugh by the fire and turning beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hands and quivering.  i wer sure hed sarve ye out hes a grand lad hes getten t raight sperrit in him he knawsay he knaws as weel as i do who sud be t maister yonderech ech ech he made ye skift properly ech ech ech  where must we go i asked of my cousin disregarding the old wretchs mockery.  linton was white and trembling. he was not pretty then ellen oh no he looked frightful for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic powerless fury. he grasped the handle of the door and shook it it was fastened inside.  if you dont let me in ill kill youif you dont let me in ill kill you he rather shrieked than said. devil devilill kill youill kill you  joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.  thear thats t father he cried. thats father weve allas summut o either side in us. niver heed hareton laddunnut be feardhe cannot get at thee  i took hold of lintons hands and tried to pull him away but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed. at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing blood gushed from his mouth and he fell on the ground. i ran into the yard sick with terror and called for zillah as loud as i could. she soon heard me she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn and hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do i hadnt breath to explain dragging her in i looked about for linton. earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs. zillah and i ascended after him but he stopped me at the top of the steps and said i shouldnt go in i must go home. i exclaimed that he had killed linton and i would enter. joseph locked the door and declared i should do no sich stuff and asked me whether i were bahn to be as mad as him. i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared. she affirmed he would be better in a bit but he couldnt do with that shrieking and din and she took me and nearly carried me into the house.  ellen i was ready to tear my hair off my head i sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite presuming every now and then to bid me wisht and denying that it was his fault and finally frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa and that he should be put in prison and hanged he commenced blubbering himself and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation. still i was not rid of him when at length they compelled me to depart and i had got some hundred yards off the premises he suddenly issued from the shadow of the roadside and checked minny and took hold of me.  miss catherine im ill grieved he began but its rayther too bad  i gave him a cut with my whip thinking perhaps he would murder me. he let go thundering one of his horrid curses and i galloped home more than half out of my senses.  i didnt bid you goodnight that evening and i didnt go to wuthering heights the next i wished to go exceedingly but i was strangely excited and dreaded to hear that linton was dead sometimes and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton. on the third day i took courage at least i couldnt bear longer suspense and stole off once more. i went at five oclock and walked fancying i might manage to creep into the house and up to lintons room unobserved. however the dogs gave notice of my approach. zillah received me and saying the lad was mending nicely showed me into a small tidy carpeted apartment where to my inexpressible joy i beheld linton laid on a little sofa reading one of my books. but he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour ellen he has such an unhappy temper. and what quite confounded me when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar and hareton was not to blame unable to reply except passionately i got up and walked from the room. he sent after me a faint catherine he did not reckon on being answered so but i wouldnt turn back and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home nearly determined to visit him no more. but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up and never hearing anything about him that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed. it had appeared wrong to take the journey once now it seemed wrong to refrain. michael came to ask if he must saddle minny i said yes and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court it was no use trying to conceal my presence.  young master is in the house said zillah as she saw me making for the parlour. i went in earnshaw was there also but he quitted the room directly. linton sat in the great armchair half asleep walking up to the fire i began in a serious tone partly meaning it to be true  as you dont like me linton and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you and pretend that i do so every time this is our last meeting let us say goodbye and tell mr. heathcliff that you have no wish to see me and that he mustnt invent any more falsehoods on the subject.  sit down and take your hat off catherine he answered. you are so much happier than i am you ought to be better. papa talks enough of my defects and shows enough scorn of me to make it natural i should doubt myself. i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently and then i feel so cross and bitter i hate everybody i am worthless and bad in temper and bad in spirit almost always and if you choose you may say goodbye youll get rid of an annoyance. only catherine do me this justice believe that if i might be as sweet and as kind and as good as you are i would be as willingly and more so than as happy and as healthy. and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love and though i couldnt and cannot help showing my nature to you i regret it and repent it and shall regret and repent it till i die  i felt he spoke the truth and i felt i must forgive him and though we should quarrel the next moment i must forgive him again. we were reconciled but we cried both of us the whole time i stayed not entirely for sorrow yet i was sorry linton had that distorted nature. hell never let his friends be at ease and hell never be at ease himself i have always gone to his little parlour since that night because his father returned the day after.  about three times i think we have been merry and hopeful as we were the first evening the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled now with his selfishness and spite and now with his sufferings but ive learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter. mr. heathcliff purposely avoids me i have hardly seen him at all. last sunday indeed coming earlier than usual i heard him abusing poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. i cant tell how he knew of it unless he listened. linton had certainly behaved provokingly however it was the business of nobody but me and i interrupted mr. heathcliffs lecture by entering and telling him so. he burst into a laugh and went away saying he was glad i took that view of the matter. since then ive told linton he must whisper his bitter things. now ellen you have heard all. i cant be prevented from going to wuthering heights except by inflicting misery on two people whereas if youll only not tell papa my going need disturb the tranquillity of none. youll not tell will you it will be very heartless if you do.  ill make up my mind on that point by tomorrow miss catherine i replied. it requires some study and so ill leave you to your rest and go think it over.  i thought it over aloud in my masters presence walking straight from her room to his and relating the whole story with the exception of her conversations with her cousin and any mention of hareton. mr. linton was alarmed and distressed more than he would acknowledge to me. in the morning catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end. in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict and implored her father to have pity on linton all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights. perhaps had he been aware of his nephews disposition and state of health he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.     chapter xxv   these things happened last winter sir said mrs. dean hardly more than a year ago. last winter i did not think at another twelve months end i should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them yet who knows how long youll be a stranger youre too young to rest always contented living by yourself and i some way fancy no one could see catherine linton and not love her. you smile but why do you look so lively and interested when i talk about her and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace and why  stop my good friend i cried. it may be very possible that i should love her but would she love me i doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation and then my home is not here. im of the busy world and to its arms i must return. go on. was catherine obedient to her fathers commands  she was continued the housekeeper. her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart and he spoke without anger he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her. he said to me a few days afterwards i wish my nephew would write ellen or call. tell me sincerely what you think of him is he changed for the better or is there a prospect of improvement as he grows a man  hes very delicate sir i replied and scarcely likely to reach manhood but this i can say he does not resemble his father and if miss catherine had the misfortune to marry him he would not be beyond her control unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent. however master youll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her it wants four years and more to his being of age.  edgar sighed and walking to the window looked out towards gimmerton kirk. it was a misty afternoon but the february sun shone dimly and we could just distinguish the two firtrees in the yard and the sparelyscattered gravestones.  ive prayed often he half soliloquised for the approach of what is coming and now i begin to shrink and fear it. i thought the memory of the hour i came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that i was soon in a few months or possibly weeks to be carried up and laid in its lonely hollow ellen ive been very happy with my little cathy through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side. but ive been as happy musing by myself among those stones under that old church lying through the long june evenings on the green mound of her mothers grave and wishingyearning for the time when i might lie beneath it. what can i do for cathy how must i quit her id not care one moment for linton being heathcliffs son nor for his taking her from me if he could console her for my loss. id not care that heathcliff gained his ends and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing but should linton be unworthyonly a feeble tool to his fatheri cannot abandon her to him and hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit i must persevere in making her sad while i live and leaving her solitary when i die. darling id rather resign her to god and lay her in the earth before me.  resign her to god as it is sir i answered and if we should lose youwhich may he forbidunder his providence ill stand her friend and counsellor to the last. miss catherine is a good girl i dont fear that she will go wilfully wrong and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded.  spring advanced yet my master gathered no real strength though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. to her inexperienced notions this itself was a sign of convalescence and then his cheek was often flushed and his eyes were bright she felt sure of his recovering. on her seventeenth birthday he did not visit the churchyard it was raining and i observed  youll surely not go out tonight sir  he answeredno ill defer it this year a little longer.  he wrote again to linton expressing his great desire to see him and had the invalid been presentable ive no doubt his father would have permitted him to come. as it was being instructed he returned an answer intimating that mr. heathcliff objected to his calling at the grange but his uncles kind remembrance delighted him and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.  that part of his letter was simple and probably his own. heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for catherines company then.  i do not ask he said that she may visit here but am i never to see her because my father forbids me to go to her home and you forbid her to come to mine do now and then ride with her towards the heights and let us exchange a few words in your presence we have done nothing to deserve this separation and you are not angry with me you have no reason to dislike me you allow yourself. dear uncle send me a kind note tomorrow and leave to join you anywhere you please except at thrushcross grange. i believe an interview would convince you that my fathers character is not mine he affirms i am more your nephew than his son and though i have faults which render me unworthy of catherine she has excused them and for her sake you should also. you inquire after my healthit is better but while i remain cut off from all hope and doomed to solitude or the society of those who never did and never will like me how can i be cheerful and well  edgar though he felt for the boy could not consent to grant his request because he could not accompany catherine. he said in summer perhaps they might meet meantime he wished him to continue writing at intervals and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter being well aware of his hard position in his family. linton complied and had he been unrestrained would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations but his father kept a sharp watch over him and of course insisted on every line that my master sent being shown so instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love and gently intimated that mr. linton must allow an interview soon or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.  cathy was a powerful ally at home and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week under my guardianship and on the moors nearest the grange for june found him still declining. though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young ladys fortune he had a natural desire that she might retainor at least return in a short time tothe house of her ancestors and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself nor had any one i believe no doctor visited the heights and no one saw master heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. i for my part began to fancy my forebodings were false and that he must be actually rallying when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object. i could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as i afterwards learned heathcliff had treated him to compel this apparent eagerness his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death.     chapter xxvi   summer was already past its prime when edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties and catherine and i set out on our first ride to join her cousin. it was a close sultry day devoid of sunshine but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guidestone by the crossroads. on arriving there however a little herdboy despatched as a messenger told us thatmaister linton wer just o this side th heights and hed be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.  then master linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle i observed he bid us keep on the grange land and here we are off at once.  well well turn our horses heads round when we reach him answered my companion our excursion shall lie towards home.  but when we reached him and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door we found he had no horse and we were forced to dismount and leave ours to graze. he lay on the heath awaiting our approach and did not rise till we came within a few yards. then he walked so feebly and looked so pale that i immediately exclaimedwhy master heathcliff you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. how ill you do look  catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm and the congratulation on their longpostponed meeting to an anxious inquiry whether he were worse than usual  nobetterbetter he panted trembling and retaining her hand as if he needed its support while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed.  but you have been worse persisted his cousin worse than when i saw you last you are thinner and  im tired he interrupted hurriedly. it is too hot for walking let us rest here. and in the morning i often feel sickpapa says i grow so fast.  badly satisfied cathy sat down and he reclined beside her.  this is something like your paradise said she making an effort at cheerfulness. you recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest this is nearly yours only there are clouds but then they are so soft and mellow it is nicer than sunshine. next week if you can well ride down to the grange park and try mine.  linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. his lack of interest in the subjects she started and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment. an indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner. the pettishness that might be caressed into fondness had yielded to a listless apathy there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed and more of the selfabsorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid repelling consolation and ready to regard the goodhumoured mirth of others as an insult. catherine perceived as well as i did that he held it rather a punishment than a gratification to endure our company and she made no scruple of proposing presently to depart. that proposal unexpectedly roused linton from his lethargy and threw him into a strange state of agitation. he glanced fearfully towards the heights begging she would remain another halfhour at least.  but i think said cathy youd be more comfortable at home than sitting here and i cannot amuse you today i see by my tales and songs and chatter you have grown wiser than i in these six months you have little taste for my diversions now or else if i could amuse you id willingly stay.  stay to rest yourself he replied. and catherine dont think or say that im very unwell it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull and i walked about before you came a great deal for me. tell uncle im in tolerable health will you  ill tell him that you say so linton. i couldnt affirm that you are observed my young lady wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth.  and be here again next thursday continued he shunning her puzzled gaze. and give him my thanks for permitting you to comemy best thanks catherine. andand if you did meet my father and he asked you about me dont lead him to suppose that ive been extremely silent and stupid dont look sad and downcast as you are doinghell be angry.  i care nothing for his anger exclaimed cathy imagining she would be its object.  but i do said her cousin shuddering. dont provoke him against me catherine for he is very hard.  is he severe to you master heathcliff i inquired. has he grown weary of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred  linton looked at me but did not answer and after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes during which his head fell drowsily on his breast and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries and sharing the produce of her researches with me she did not offer them to him for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.  is it halfanhour now ellen she whispered in my ear at last. i cant tell why we should stay. hes asleep and papa will be wanting us back.  well we must not leave him asleep i answered wait till he wakes and be patient. you were mighty eager to set off but your longing to see poor linton has soon evaporated  why did he wish to see me returned catherine. in his crossest humours formerly i liked him better than i do in his present curious mood. its just as if it were a task he was compelled to performthis interviewfor fear his father should scold him. but im hardly going to come to give mr. heathcliff pleasure whatever reason he may have for ordering linton to undergo this penance. and though im glad hes better in health im sorry hes so much less pleasant and so much less affectionate to me.  you think he is better in health then i said.  yes she answered because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings you know. he is not tolerably well as he told me to tell papa but hes better very likely.  there you differ with me miss cathy i remarked i should conjecture him to be far worse.  linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror and asked if any one had called his name.  no said catherine unless in dreams. i cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors in the morning.  i thought i heard my father he gasped glancing up to the frowning nab above us. you are sure nobody spoke  quite sure replied his cousin. only ellen and i were disputing concerning your health. are you truly stronger linton than when we separated in winter if you be im certain one thing is not strongeryour regard for me speakare you  the tears gushed from lintons eyes as he answered yes yes i am and still under the spell of the imaginary voice his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner.  cathy rose. for today we must part she said. and i wont conceal that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting though ill mention it to nobody but you not that i stand in awe of mr. heathcliff.  hush murmured linton for gods sake hush hes coming. and he clung to catherines arm striving to detain her but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself and whistled to minny who obeyed her like a dog.  ill be here next thursday she cried springing to the saddle. goodbye. quick ellen  and so we left him scarcely conscious of our departure so absorbed was he in anticipating his fathers approach.  before we reached home catherines displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague uneasy doubts about lintons actual circumstances physical and social in which i partook though i counselled her not to say much for a second journey would make us better judges. my master requested an account of our ongoings. his nephews offering of thanks was duly delivered miss cathy gently touching on the rest i also threw little light on his inquiries for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.     chapter xxvii   seven days glided away every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of edgar lintons state. the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. catherine we would fain have deluded yet but her own quick spirit refused to delude her it divined in secret and brooded on the dreadful probability gradually ripening into certainty. she had not the heart to mention her ride when thursday came round i mentioned it for her and obtained permission to order her out of doors for the library where her father stopped a short time dailythe brief period he could bear to sit upand his chamber had become her whole world. she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow or seated by his side. her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.  he had a fixed idea i guessed by several observations he let fall that as his nephew resembled him in person he would resemble him in mind for lintons letters bore few or no indications of his defective character. and i through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.  we deferred our excursion till the afternoon a golden afternoon of august every breath from the hills so full of life that it seemed whoever respired it though dying might revive. catherines face was just like the landscapeshadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.  we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. my young mistress alighted and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback but i dissented i wouldnt risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute so we climbed the slope of heath together. master heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion not the animation of high spirits though nor yet of joy it looked more like fear.  it is late he said speaking short and with difficulty. is not your father very ill i thought you wouldnt come.  why wont you be candid cried catherine swallowing her greeting. why cannot you say at once you dont want me it is strange linton that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose apparently to distress us both and for no reason besides  linton shivered and glanced at her half supplicating half ashamed but his cousins patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour.  my father is very ill she said and why am i called from his bedside why didnt you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished i wouldnt keep it come i desire an explanation playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind and i cant dance attendance on your affectations now  my affectations he murmured what are they for heavens sake catherine dont look so angry despise me as much as you please i am a worthless cowardly wretch i cant be scorned enough but im too mean for your anger. hate my father and spare me for contempt.  nonsense cried catherine in a passion. foolish silly boy and there he trembles as if i were really going to touch him you neednt bespeak contempt linton anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. get off i shall return home it is folly dragging you from the hearthstone and pretendingwhat do we pretend let go my frock if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened you should spurn such pity. ellen tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. rise and dont degrade yourself into an abject reptiledont  with streaming face and an expression of agony linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror.  oh he sobbed i cannot bear it catherine catherine im a traitor too and i dare not tell you but leave me and i shall be killed dear catherine my life is in your hands and you have said you loved me and if you did it wouldnt harm you. youll not go then kind sweet good catherine and perhaps you will consentand hell let me die with you  my young lady on witnessing his intense anguish stooped to raise him. the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.  consent to what she asked. to stay tell me the meaning of this strange talk and i will. you contradict your own words and distract me be calm and frank and confess at once all that weighs on your heart. you wouldnt injure me linton would you you wouldnt let any enemy hurt me if you could prevent it ill believe you are a coward for yourself but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.  but my father threatened me gasped the boy clasping his attenuated fingers and i dread himi dread him i dare not tell  oh well said catherine with scornful compassion keep your secret im no coward. save yourself im not afraid  her magnanimity provoked his tears he wept wildly kissing her supporting hands and yet could not summon courage to speak out. i was cogitating what the mystery might be and determined catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else by my good will when hearing a rustle among the ling i looked up and saw mr. heathcliff almost close upon us descending the heights. he didnt cast a glance towards my companions though they were sufficiently near for lintons sobs to be audible but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides and the sincerity of which i couldnt avoid doubting he said  it is something to see you so near to my house nelly. how are you at the grange let us hear. the rumour goes he added in a lower tone that edgar linton is on his deathbed perhaps they exaggerate his illness  no my master is dying i replied it is true enough. a sad thing it will be for us all but a blessing for him  how long will he last do you think he asked.  i dont know i said.  because he continued looking at the two young people who were fixed under his eyelinton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head and catherine could not move on his accountbecause that lad yonder seems determined to beat me and id thank his uncle to be quick and go before him hallo has the whelp been playing that game long i did give him some lessons about snivelling. is he pretty lively with miss linton generally  lively nohe has shown the greatest distress i answered. to see him i should say that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills he ought to be in bed under the hands of a doctor.  he shall be in a day or two muttered heathcliff. but firstget up linton get up he shouted. dont grovel on the ground there up this moment  linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear caused by his fathers glance towards him i suppose there was nothing else to produce such humiliation. he made several efforts to obey but his little strength was annihilated for the time and he fell back again with a moan. mr. heathcliff advanced and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf.  now said he with curbed ferocity im getting angryand if you dont command that paltry spirit of yoursdamn you get up directly  i will father he panted. only let me alone or i shall faint. ive done as you wished im sure. catherine will tell you that ithat ihave been cheerful. ah keep by me catherine give me your hand.  take mine said his father stand on your feet. there nowshell lend you her arm thats right look at her. you would imagine i was the devil himself miss linton to excite such horror. be so kind as to walk home with him will you he shudders if i touch him.  linton dear whispered catherine i cant go to wuthering heights papa has forbidden me. hell not harm you why are you so afraid  i can never reenter that house he answered. im not to reenter it without you  stop cried his father. well respect catherines filial scruples. nelly take him in and ill follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay.  youll do well replied i. but i must remain with my mistress to mind your son is not my business.  you are very stiff said heathcliff i know that but youll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. come then my hero. are you willing to return escorted by me  he approached once more and made as if he would seize the fragile being but shrinking back linton clung to his cousin and implored her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial. however i disapproved i couldnt hinder her indeed how could she have refused him herself what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning but there he was powerless under its gripe and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. we reached the threshold catherine walked in and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair expecting her out immediately when mr. heathcliff pushing me forward exclaimedmy house is not stricken with the plague nelly and i have a mind to be hospitable today sit down and allow me to shut the door.  he shut and locked it also. i started.  you shall have tea before you go home he added. i am by myself. hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure and though im used to being alone id rather have some interesting company if i can get it. miss linton take your seat by him. i give you what i have the present is hardly worth accepting but i have nothing else to offer. it is linton i mean. how she does stare its odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty i should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two as an evenings amusement.  he drew in his breath struck the table and swore to himself by hell i hate them.  i am not afraid of you exclaimed catherine who could not hear the latter part of his speech. she stepped close up her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution. give me that key i will have it she said. i wouldnt eat or drink here if i were starving.  heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. he looked up seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness or possibly reminded by her voice and glance of the person from whom she inherited it. she snatched at the instrument and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers but her action recalled him to the present he recovered it speedily.  now catherine linton he said stand off or i shall knock you down and that will make mrs. dean mad.  regardless of this warning she captured his closed hand and its contents again. we will go she repeated exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax and finding that her nails made no impression she applied her teeth pretty sharply. heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment. catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. he opened them suddenly and resigned the object of dispute but ere she had well secured it he seized her with the liberated hand and pulling her on his knee administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat had she been able to fall.  at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously. you villain i began to cry you villain a touch on the chest silenced me i am stout and soon put out of breath and what with that and the rage i staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate or to burst a bloodvessel. the scene was over in two minutes catherine released put her two hands to her temples and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on. she trembled like a reed poor thing and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.  i know how to chastise children you see said the scoundrel grimly as he stooped to repossess himself of the key which had dropped to the floor. go to linton now as i told you and cry at your ease i shall be your father tomorrowall the father youll have in a few daysand you shall have plenty of that. you can bear plenty youre no weakling you shall have a daily taste if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again  cathy ran to me instead of linton and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap weeping aloud. her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle as quiet as a mouse congratulating himself i dare say that the correction had alighted on another than him. mr. heathcliff perceiving us all confounded rose and expeditiously made the tea himself. the cups and saucers were laid ready. he poured it out and handed me a cup.  wash away your spleen he said. and help your own naughty pet and mine. it is not poisoned though i prepared it. im going out to seek your horses.  our first thought on his departure was to force an exit somewhere. we tried the kitchen door but that was fastened outside we looked at the windowsthey were too narrow for even cathys little figure.  master linton i cried seeing we were regularly imprisoned you know what your diabolical father is after and you shall tell us or ill box your ears as he has done your cousins.  yes linton you must tell said catherine. it was for your sake i came and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.  give me some tea im thirsty and then ill tell you he answered. mrs. dean go away. i dont like you standing over me. now catherine you are letting your tears fall into my cup. i wont drink that. give me another.  catherine pushed another to him and wiped her face. i felt disgusted at the little wretchs composure since he was no longer in terror for himself. the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there and that accomplished he had no further immediate fears.  papa wants us to be married he continued after sipping some of the liquid. and he knows your papa wouldnt let us marry now and hes afraid of my dying if we wait so we are to be married in the morning and you are to stay here all night and if you do as he wishes you shall return home next day and take me with you.  take you with her pitiful changeling i exclaimed. you marry why the man is mad or he thinks us fools every one. and do you imagine that beautiful young lady that healthy hearty girl will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you are you cherishing the notion that anybody let alone miss catherine linton would have you for a husband you want whipping for bringing us in here at all with your dastardly puling tricks anddont look so silly now ive a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery and your imbecile conceit.  i did give him a slight shaking but it brought on the cough and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping and catherine rebuked me.  stay all night no she said looking slowly round. ellen ill burn that door down but ill get out.  and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly but linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. he clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbingwont you have me and save me not let me come to the grange oh darling catherine you mustnt go and leave after all. you must obey my fatheryou must  i must obey my own she replied and relieve him from this cruel suspense. the whole night what would he think hell be distressed already. ill either break or burn a way out of the house. be quiet youre in no danger but if you hinder melinton i love papa better than you  the mortal terror he felt of mr. heathcliffs anger restored to the boy his cowards eloquence. catherine was near distraught still she persisted that she must go home and tried entreaty in her turn persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. while they were thus occupied our jailor reentered.  your beasts have trotted off he said andnow linton snivelling again what has she been doing to you come comehave done and get to bed. in a month or two my lad youll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. youre pining for pure love are you not nothing else in the world and she shall have you there to bed zillah wont be here tonight you must undress yourself. hush hold your noise once in your own room ill not come near you you neednt fear. by chance youve managed tolerably. ill look to the rest.  he spoke these words holding the door open for his son to pass and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. the lock was resecured. heathcliff approached the fire where my mistress and i stood silent. catherine looked up and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness but he scowled on her and mutteredoh you are not afraid of me your courage is well disguised you seem damnably afraid  i am afraid now she replied because if i stay papa will be miserable and how can i endure making him miserablewhen hewhen hemr. heathcliff let me go home i promise to marry linton papa would like me to and i love him. why should you wish to force me to do what ill willingly do of myself  let him dare to force you i cried. theres law in the land thank god there is though we be in an outoftheway place. id inform if he were my own son and its felony without benefit of clergy  silence said the ruffian. to the devil with your clamour i dont want you to speak. miss linton i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable i shall not sleep for satisfaction. you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twentyfour hours than informing me that such an event would follow. as to your promise to marry linton ill take care you shall keep it for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.  send ellen then to let papa know im safe exclaimed catherine weeping bitterly. or marry me now. poor papa ellen hell think were lost. what shall we do  not he hell think you are tired of waiting on him and run off for a little amusement answered heathcliff. you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary. and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age and that you would weary of nursing a sick man and that man only your father. catherine his happiest days were over when your days began. he cursed you i dare say for coming into the world i did at least and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it. id join him. i dont love you how should i weep away. as far as i can see it will be your chief diversion hereafter unless linton make amends for other losses and your provident parent appears to fancy he may. his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his and kind to her when he got her. careful and kindthats paternal. but linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself. linton can play the little tyrant well. hell undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. youll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness when you get home again i assure you.  youre right there i said explain your sons character. show his resemblance to yourself and then i hope miss cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice  i dont much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now he answered because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner and you along with her till your master dies. i can detain you both quite concealed here. if you doubt encourage her to retract her word and youll have an opportunity of judging  ill not retract my word said catherine. ill marry him within this hour if i may go to thrushcross grange afterwards. mr. heathcliff youre a cruel man but youre not a fiend and you wont from mere malice destroy irrevocably all my happiness. if papa thought i had left him on purpose and if he died before i returned could i bear to live ive given over crying but im going to kneel here at your knee and ill not get up and ill not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me no dont turn away do look youll see nothing to provoke you. i dont hate you. im not angry that you struck me. have you never loved anybody in all your life uncle never ah you must look once. im so wretched you cant help being sorry and pitying me.  keep your efts fingers off and move or ill kick you cried heathcliff brutally repulsing her. id rather be hugged by a snake. how the devil can you dream of fawning on me i detest you  he shrugged his shoulders shook himself indeed as if his flesh crept with aversion and thrust back his chair while i got up and opened my mouth to commence a downright torrent of abuse. but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered. it was growing darkwe heard a sound of voices at the gardengate. our host hurried out instantly he had his wits about him we had not. there was a talk of two or three minutes and he returned alone.  i thought it had been your cousin hareton i observed to catherine. i wish he would arrive who knows but he might take our part  it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange said heathcliff overhearing me. you should have opened a lattice and called out but i could swear that chit is glad you didnt. shes glad to be obliged to stay im certain.  at learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without control and he allowed us to wail on till nine oclock. then he bid us go upstairs through the kitchen to zillahs chamber and i whispered my companion to obey perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there or into a garret and out by its skylight. the window however was narrow like those below and the garret trap was safe from our attempts for we were fastened in as before. we neither of us lay down catherine took her station by the lattice and watched anxiously for morning a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. i seated myself in a chair and rocked to and fro passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty from which it struck me then all the misfortunes of my employers sprang. it was not the case in reality i am aware but it was in my imagination that dismal night and i thought heathcliff himself less guilty than i.  at seven oclock he came and inquired if miss linton had risen. she ran to the door immediately and answered yes. here then he said opening it and pulling her out. i rose to follow but he turned the lock again. i demanded my release.  be patient he replied ill send up your breakfast in a while.  i thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily and catherine asked why i was still shut up he answered i must try to endure it another hour and they went away. i endured it two or three hours at length i heard a footstep not heathcliffs.  ive brought you something to eat said a voice oppen t door  complying eagerly i beheld hareton laden with food enough to last me all day.  tak it he added thrusting the tray into my hand.  stay one minute i began.  nay cried he and retired regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him.  and there i remained enclosed the whole day and the whole of the next night and another and another. five nights and four days i remained altogether seeing nobody but hareton once every morning and he was a model of a jailor surly and dumb and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion.     chapter xxviii   on the fifth morning or rather afternoon a different step approachedlighter and shorter and this time the person entered the room. it was zillah donned in her scarlet shawl with a black silk bonnet on her head and a willowbasket swung to her arm.  eh dear mrs. dean she exclaimed. well there is a talk about you at gimmerton. i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh and missy with you till master told me youd been found and hed lodged you here what and you must have got on an island sure and how long were you in the hole did master save you mrs. dean but youre not so thinyouve not been so poorly have you  your master is a true scoundrel i replied. but he shall answer for it. he neednt have raised that tale it shall all be laid bare  what do you mean asked zillah. its not his tale they tell that in the villageabout your being lost in the marsh and i calls to earnshaw when i come ineh theys queer things mr. hareton happened since i went off. its a sad pity of that likely young lass and cant nelly dean. he stared. i thought he had not heard aught so i told him the rumour. the master listened and he just smiled to himself and said if they have been in the marsh they are out now zillah. nelly dean is lodged at this minute in your room. you can tell her to flit when you go up here is the key. the bogwater got into her head and she would have run home quite flighty but i fixed her till she came round to her senses. you can bid her go to the grange at once if she be able and carry a message from me that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squires funeral.  mr. edgar is not dead i gasped. oh zillah zillah  no no sit you down my good mistress she replied youre right sickly yet. hes not dead doctor kenneth thinks he may last another day. i met him on the road and asked.  instead of sitting down i snatched my outdoor things and hastened below for the way was free. on entering the house i looked about for some one to give information of catherine. the place was filled with sunshine and the door stood wide open but nobody seemed at hand. as i hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. linton lay on the settle sole tenant sucking a stick of sugarcandy and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes. where is miss catherine i demanded sternly supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence by catching him thus alone. he sucked on like an innocent.  is she gone i said.  no he replied shes upstairs shes not to go we wont let her.  you wont let her little idiot i exclaimed. direct me to her room immediately or ill make you sing out sharply.  papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there he answered. he says im not to be soft with catherine shes my wife and its shameful that she should wish to leave me. he says she hates me and wants me to die that she may have my money but she shant have it and she shant go home she never shallshe may cry and be sick as much as she pleases  he resumed his former occupation closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep.  master heathcliff i resumed have you forgotten all catherines kindness to you last winter when you affirmed you loved her and when she brought you books and sung you songs and came many a time through wind and snow to see you she wept to miss one evening because you would be disappointed and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you and now you believe the lies your father tells though you know he detests you both. and you join him against her. thats fine gratitude is it not  the corner of lintons mouth fell and he took the sugarcandy from his lips.  did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you i continued. think for yourself as to your money she does not even know that you will have any. and you say shes sick and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house you who have felt what it is to be so neglected you could pity your own sufferings and she pitied them too but you wont pity hers i shed tears master heathcliff you seean elderly woman and a servant merelyand you after pretending such affection and having reason to worship her almost store every tear you have for yourself and lie there quite at ease. ah youre a heartless selfish boy  i cant stay with her he answered crossly. ill not stay by myself. she cries so i cant bear it. and she wont give over though i say ill call my father. i did call him once and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet but she began again the instant he left the room moaning and grieving all night long though i screamed for vexation that i couldnt sleep.  is mr. heathcliff out i inquired perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousins mental tortures.  hes in the court he replied talking to doctor kenneth who says uncle is dying truly at last. im glad for i shall be master of the grange after him. catherine always spoke of it as her house. it isnt hers its mine papa says everything she has is mine. all her nice books are mine she offered to give me them and her pretty birds and her pony minny if i would get the key of our room and let her out but i told her she had nothing to give they were all all mine. and then she cried and took a little picture from her neck and said i should have that two pictures in a gold case on one side her mother and on the other uncle when they were young. that was yesterdayi said they were mine too and tried to get them from her. the spiteful thing wouldnt let me she pushed me off and hurt me. i shrieked outthat frightens hershe heard papa coming and she broke the hinges and divided the case and gave me her mothers portrait the other she attempted to hide but papa asked what was the matter and i explained it. he took the one i had away and ordered her to resign hers to me she refused and hehe struck her down and wrenched it off the chain and crushed it with his foot.  and were you pleased to see her struck i asked having my designs in encouraging his talk.  i winked he answered i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse he does it so hard. yet i was glad at firstshe deserved punishing for pushing me but when papa was gone she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside against her teeth and her mouth filling with blood and then she gathered up the bits of the picture and went and sat down with her face to the wall and she has never spoken to me since and i sometimes think she cant speak for pain. i dont like to think so but shes a naughty thing for crying continually and she looks so pale and wild im afraid of her.  and you can get the key if you choose i said.  yes when i am upstairs he answered but i cant walk upstairs now.  in what apartment is it i asked.  oh he cried i shant tell you where it is. it is our secret. nobody neither hareton nor zillah is to know. there youve tired mego away go away and he turned his face on to his arm and shut his eyes again.  i considered it best to depart without seeing mr. heathcliff and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange. on reaching it the astonishment of my fellowservants to see me and their joy also was intense and when they heard that their little mistress was safe two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr. edgars door but i bespoke the announcement of it myself. how changed i found him even in those few days he lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death. very young he looked though his actual age was thirtynine one would have called him ten years younger at least. he thought of catherine for he murmured her name. i touched his hand and spoke.  catherine is coming dear master i whispered she is alive and well and will be here i hope tonight.  i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence he half rose up looked eagerly round the apartment and then sank back in a swoon. as soon as he recovered i related our compulsory visit and detention at the heights. i said heathcliff forced me to go in which was not quite true. i uttered as little as possible against linton nor did i describe all his fathers brutal conductmy intentions being to add no bitterness if i could help it to his already overflowing cup.  he divined that one of his enemys purposes was to secure the personal property as well as the estate to his son or rather himself yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together. however he felt that his will had better be altered instead of leaving catherines fortune at her own disposal he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life and for her children if she had any after her. by that means it could not fall to mr. heathcliff should linton die.  having received his orders i despatched a man to fetch the attorney and four more provided with serviceable weapons to demand my young lady of her jailor. both parties were delayed very late. the single servant returned first. he said mr. green the lawyer was out when he arrived at his house and he had to wait two hours for his reentrance and then mr. green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning. the four men came back unaccompanied also. they brought word that catherine was ill too ill to quit her room and heathcliff would not suffer them to see her. i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale which i would not carry to my master resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights at daylight and storm it literally unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. her father shall see her i vowed and vowed again if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it  happily i was spared the journey and the trouble. i had gone downstairs at three oclock to fetch a jug of water and was passing through the hall with it in my hand when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump. oh it is green i said recollecting myselfonly green and i went on intending to send somebody else to open it but the knock was repeated not loud and still importunately. i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. the harvest moon shone clear outside. it was not the attorney. my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing ellen ellen is papa alive  yes i cried yes my angel he is god be thanked you are safe with us again  she wanted to run breathless as she was upstairs to mr. lintons room but i compelled her to sit down on a chair and made her drink and washed her pale face chafing it into a faint colour with my apron. then i said i must go first and tell of her arrival imploring her to say she should be happy with young heathcliff. she stared but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood she assured me she would not complain.  i couldnt abide to be present at their meeting. i stood outside the chamberdoor a quarter of an hour and hardly ventured near the bed then. all was composed however catherines despair was as silent as her fathers joy. she supported him calmly in appearance and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.  he died blissfully mr. lockwood he died so. kissing her cheek he murmuredi am going to her and you darling child shall come to us and never stirred or spoke again but continued that rapt radiant gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. none could have noticed the exact minute of his death it was so entirely without a struggle.  whether catherine had spent her tears or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow she sat there dryeyed till the sun rose she sat till noon and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. it was well i succeeded in removing her for at dinnertime appeared the lawyer having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave. he had sold himself to mr. heathcliff that was the cause of his delay in obeying my masters summons. fortunately no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latters mind to disturb him after his daughters arrival.  mr. green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place. he gave all the servants but me notice to quit. he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar linton should not be buried beside his wife but in the chapel with his family. there was the will however to hinder that and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions. the funeral was hurried over catherine mrs. linton heathcliff now was suffered to stay at the grange till her fathers corpse had quitted it.  she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk of liberating her. she heard the men i sent disputing at the door and she gathered the sense of heathcliffs answer. it drove her desperate. linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left was terrified into fetching the key before his father reascended. he had the cunning to unlock and relock the door without shutting it and when he should have gone to bed he begged to sleep with hareton and his petition was granted for once. catherine stole out before break of day. she dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows and luckily lighting on her mothers she got easily out of its lattice and on to the ground by means of the firtree close by. her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape notwithstanding his timid contrivances.     chapter xxix   the evening after the funeral my young lady and i were seated in the library now musing mournfullyone of us despairinglyon our loss now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.  we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the grange at least during lintons life he being allowed to join her there and i to remain as housekeeper. that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for and yet i did hope and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment and above all my beloved young mistress when a servantone of the discarded ones not yet departedrushed hastily in and said that devil heathcliff was coming through the court should he fasten the door in his face  if we had been mad enough to order that proceeding we had not time. he made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name he was master and availed himself of the masters privilege to walk straight in without saying a word. the sound of our informants voice directed him to the library he entered and motioning him out shut the door.  it was the same room into which he had been ushered as a guest eighteen years before the same moon shone through the window and the same autumn landscape lay outside. we had not yet lighted a candle but all the apartment was visible even to the portraits on the wall the splendid head of mrs. linton and the graceful one of her husband. heathcliff advanced to the hearth. time had little altered his person either. there was the same man his dark face rather sallower and more composed his frame a stone or two heavier perhaps and no other difference. catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out when she saw him.  stop he said arresting her by the arm. no more runnings away where would you go im come to fetch you home and i hope youll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. i was embarrassed how to punish him when i discovered his part in the business hes such a cobweb a pinch would annihilate him but youll see by his look that he has received his due i brought him down one evening the day before yesterday and just set him in a chair and never touched him afterwards. i sent hareton out and we had the room to ourselves. in two hours i called joseph to carry him up again and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost and i fancy he sees me often though i am not near. hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together and calls you to protect him from me and whether you like your precious mate or not you must come hes your concern now i yield all my interest in him to you.  why not let catherine continue here i pleaded and send master linton to her as you hate them both youd not miss them they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.  im seeking a tenant for the grange he answered and i want my children about me to be sure. besides that lass owes me her services for her bread. im not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after linton is gone. make haste and get ready now and dont oblige me to compel you.  i shall said catherine. linton is all i have to love in the world and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me and me to him you cannot make us hate each other. and i defy you to hurt him when i am by and i defy you to frighten me  you are a boastful champion replied heathcliff but i dont like you well enough to hurt him you shall get the full benefit of the torment as long as it lasts. it is not i who will make him hateful to youit is his own sweet spirit. hes as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences dont expect thanks for this noble devotion. i heard him draw a pleasant picture to zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as i the inclination is there and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.  i know he has a bad nature said catherine hes your son. but im glad ive a better to forgive it and i know he loves me and for that reason i love him. mr. heathcliff you have nobody to love you and however miserable you make us we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. you are miserable are you not lonely like the devil and envious like him nobody loves younobody will cry for you when you die i wouldnt be you  catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.  you shall be sorry to be yourself presently said her fatherinlaw if you stand there another minute. begone witch and get your things  she scornfully withdrew. in her absence i began to beg for zillahs place at the heights offering to resign mine to her but he would suffer it on no account. he bid me be silent and then for the first time allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures. having studied mrs. lintons he saidi shall have that home. not because i need it but he turned abruptly to the fire and continued with what for lack of a better word i must call a smileill tell you what i did yesterday i got the sexton who was digging lintons grave to remove the earth off her coffin lid and i opened it. i thought once i would have stayed there when i saw her face againit is hers yethe had hard work to stir me but he said it would change if the air blew on it and so i struck one side of the coffin loose and covered it up not lintons side damn him i wish hed been soldered in lead. and i bribed the sexton to pull it away when im laid there and slide mine out too ill have it made so and then by the time linton gets to us hell not know which is which  you were very wicked mr. heathcliff i exclaimed were you not ashamed to disturb the dead  i disturbed nobody nelly he replied and i gave some ease to myself. i shall be a great deal more comfortable now and youll have a better chance of keeping me underground when i get there. disturbed her no she has disturbed me night and day through eighteen yearsincessantlyremorselesslytill yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil. i dreamt i was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.  and if she had been dissolved into earth or worse what would you have dreamt of then i said.  of dissolving with her and being more happy still he answered. do you suppose i dread any change of that sort i expected such a transformation on raising the lid but im better pleased that it should not commence till i share it. besides unless i had received a distinct impression of her passionless features that strange feeling would hardly have been removed. it began oddly. you know i was wild after she died and eternally from dawn to dawn praying her to return to me her spirit i have a strong faith in ghosts i have a conviction that they can and do exist among us the day she was buried there came a fall of snow. in the evening i went to the churchyard. it blew bleak as winterall round was solitary. i didnt fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late and no one else had business to bring them there. being alone and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us i said to myselfill have her in my arms again if she be cold ill think it is this north wind that chills me and if she be motionless it is sleep. i got a spade from the toolhouse and began to delve with all my mightit scraped the coffin i fell to work with my hands the wood commenced cracking about the screws i was on the point of attaining my object when it seemed that i heard a sigh from some one above close at the edge of the grave and bending down. if i can only get this off i muttered i wish they may shovel in the earth over us both and i wrenched at it more desperately still. there was another sigh close at my ear. i appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleetladen wind. i knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by but as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark though it cannot be discerned so certainly i felt that cathy was there not under me but on the earth. a sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb. i relinquished my labour of agony and turned consoled at once unspeakably consoled. her presence was with me it remained while i refilled the grave and led me home. you may laugh if you will but i was sure i should see her there. i was sure she was with me and i could not help talking to her. having reached the heights i rushed eagerly to the door. it was fastened and i remember that accursed earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. i remember stopping to kick the breath out of him and then hurrying upstairs to my room and hers. i looked round impatientlyi felt her by mei could almost see her and yet i could not i ought to have sweat blood then from the anguish of my yearningfrom the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse i had not one. she showed herself as she often was in life a devil to me and since then sometimes more and sometimes less ive been the sport of that intolerable torture infernal keeping my nerves at such a stretch that if they had not resembled catgut they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of lintons. when i sat in the house with hareton it seemed that on going out i should meet her when i walked on the moors i should meet her coming in. when i went from home i hastened to return she must be somewhere at the heights i was certain and when i slept in her chamberi was beaten out of that. i couldnt lie there for the moment i closed my eyes she was either outside the window or sliding back the panels or entering the room or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child and i must open my lids to see. and so i opened and closed them a hundred times a nightto be always disappointed it racked me ive often groaned aloud till that old rascal joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. now since ive seen her im pacifieda little. it was a strange way of killing not by inches but by fractions of hairbreadths to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years  mr. heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead his hair clung to it wet with perspiration his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire the brows not contracted but raised next the temples diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance but imparting a peculiar look of trouble and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject. he only half addressed me and i maintained silence. i didnt like to hear him talk after a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage and while so occupied catherine entered announcing that she was ready when her pony should be saddled.  send that over tomorrow said heathcliff to me then turning to her he added you may do without your pony it is a fine evening and youll need no ponies at wuthering heights for what journeys you take your own feet will serve you. come along.  goodbye ellen whispered my dear little mistress. as she kissed me her lips felt like ice. come and see me ellen dont forget.  take care you do no such thing mrs. dean said her new father. when i wish to speak to you ill come here. i want none of your prying at my house  he signed her to precede him and casting back a look that cut my heart she obeyed. i watched them from the window walk down the garden. heathcliff fixed catherines arm under his though she disputed the act at first evidently and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley whose trees concealed them.     chapter xxx   i have paid a visit to the heights but i have not seen her since she left joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her and wouldnt let me pass. he said mrs. linton was thrang and the master was not in. zillah has told me something of the way they go on otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living. she thinks catherine haughty and does not like her i can guess by her talk. my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came but mr. heathcliff told her to follow her own business and let his daughterinlaw look after herself and zillah willingly acquiesced being a narrowminded selfish woman. catherine evinced a childs annoyance at this neglect repaid it with contempt and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies as securely as if she had done her some great wrong. i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago a little before you came one day when we foregathered on the moor and this is what she told me.  the first thing mrs. linton did she said on her arrival at the heights was to run upstairs without even wishing goodevening to me and joseph she shut herself into lintons room and remained till morning. then while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for her cousin was very ill.  we know that answered heathcliff but his life is not worth a farthing and i wont spend a farthing on him.  but i cannot tell how to do she said and if nobody will help me hell die  walk out of the room cried the master and let me never hear a word more about him none here care what becomes of him if you do act the nurse if you do not lock him up and leave him.  then she began to bother me and i said id had enough plague with the tiresome thing we each had our tasks and hers was to wait on linton mr. heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.  how they managed together i cant tell. i fancy he fretted a great deal and moaned hisseln night and day and she had precious little rest one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like and looked as if she would fain beg assistance but i was not going to disobey the master i never dare disobey him mrs. dean and though i thought it wrong that kenneth should not be sent for it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain and i always refused to meddle. once or twice after we had gone to bed ive happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairstop and then ive shut myself in quick for fear of being moved to interfere. i did pity her then im sure still i didnt wish to lose my place you know.  at last one night she came boldly into my chamber and frightened me out of my wits by saying tell mr. heathcliff that his son is dyingim sure he is this time. get up instantly and tell him.  having uttered this speech she vanished again. i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling. nothing stirredthe house was quiet.  shes mistaken i said to myself. hes got over it. i neednt disturb them and i began to doze. but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bellthe only bell we have put up on purpose for linton and the master called to me to see what was the matter and inform them that he wouldnt have that noise repeated.  i delivered catherines message. he cursed to himself and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle and proceeded to their room. i followed. mrs. heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hands folded on her knees. her fatherinlaw went up held the light to lintons face looked at him and touched him afterwards he turned to her.  nowcatherine he said how do you feel  she was dumb.  how do you feel catherine he repeated.  hes safe and im free she answered i should feel wellbut she continued with a bitterness she couldnt conceal you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that i feel and see only death i feel like death  and she looked like it too i gave her a little wine. hareton and joseph who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet and heard our talk from outside now entered. joseph was fain i believe of the lads removal hareton seemed a thought bothered though he was more taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton. but the master bid him get off to bed again we didnt want his help. he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber and told me to return to mine and mrs. heathcliff remained by herself.  in the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast she had undressed and appeared going to sleep and said she was ill at which i hardly wondered. i informed mr. heathcliff and he repliedwell let her be till after the funeral and go up now and then to get her what is needful and as soon as she seems better tell me.  cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight according to zillah who visited her twice a day and would have been rather more friendly but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.  heathcliff went up once to show her lintons will. he had bequeathed the whole of his and what had been her moveable property to his father the poor creature was threatened or coaxed into that act during her weeks absence when his uncle died. the lands being a minor he could not meddle with. however mr. heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wifes right and his also i suppose legally at any rate catherine destitute of cash and friends cannot disturb his possession.  nobody said zillah ever approached her door except that once but i and nobody asked anything about her. the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon. she had cried out when i carried up her dinner that she couldnt bear any longer being in the cold and i told her the master was going to thrushcross grange and earnshaw and i neednt hinder her from descending so as soon as she heard heathcliffs horse trot off she made her appearance donned in black and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker she couldnt comb them out.  joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays the kirk you know has no minister now explained mrs. dean and they call the methodists or baptists place i cant say which it is at gimmerton a chapel. joseph had gone she continued but i thought proper to bide at home. young folks are always the better for an elders overlooking and hareton with all his bashfulness isnt a model of nice behaviour. i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed. he coloured up at the news and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes. the trainoil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. i saw he meant to give her his company and i guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable so laughing as i durst not laugh when the master is by i offered to help him if he would and joked at his confusion. he grew sullen and began to swear.  now mrs. dean zillah went on seeing me not pleased by her manner you happen think your young lady too fine for mr. hareton and happen youre right but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower. and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now shes as poor as you or i poorer ill be bound youre saving and im doing my little all that road.  hareton allowed zillah to give him her aid and she flattered him into a good humour so when catherine came half forgetting her former insults he tried to make himself agreeable by the housekeepers account.  missis walked in she said as chill as an icicle and as high as a princess. i got up and offered her my seat in the armchair. no she turned up her nose at my civility. earnshaw rose too and bid her come to the settle and sit close by the fire he was sure she was starved.  ive been starved a month and more she answered resting on the word as scornful as she could.  and she got a chair for herself and placed it at a distance from both of us. having sat till she was warm she began to look round and discovered a number of books on the dresser she was instantly upon her feet again stretching to reach them but they were too high up. her cousin after watching her endeavours a while at last summoned courage to help her she held her frock and he filled it with the first that came to hand.  that was a great advance for the lad. she didnt thank him still he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance and ventured to stand behind as she examined them and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book. she continued reading or seeking for something to read. his attention became by degrees quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls her face he couldnt see and she couldnt see him. and perhaps not quite awake to what he did but attracted like a child to a candle at last he proceeded from staring to touching he put out his hand and stroked one curl as gently as if it were a bird. he might have stuck a knife into her neck she started round in such a taking.  get away this moment how dare you touch me why are you stopping there she cried in a tone of disgust. i cant endure you ill go upstairs again if you come near me.  mr. hareton recoiled looking as foolish as he could do he sat down in the settle very quiet and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour finally earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me.  will you ask her to read to us zillah im stalled of doing naught and i do likei could like to hear her dunnot say i wanted it but ask of yourseln.  mr. hareton wishes you would read to us maam i said immediately. hed take it very kindhed be much obliged.  she frowned and looking up answered  mr. hareton and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer i despise you and will have nothing to say to any of you when i would have given my life for one kind word even to see one of your faces you all kept off. but i wont complain to you im driven down here by the cold not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.  what could i ha done began earnshaw. how was i to blame  oh you are an exception answered mrs. heathcliff. i never missed such a concern as you.  but i offered more than once and asked he said kindling up at her pertness i asked mr. heathcliff to let me wake for you  be silent ill go out of doors or anywhere rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear said my lady.  hareton muttered she might go to hell for him and unslinging his gun restrained himself from his sunday occupations no longer. he talked now freely enough and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she was forced to condescend to our company more and more. however i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature ever since ive been as stiff as herself and she has no lover or liker among us and she does not deserve one for let them say the least word to her and shell curl back without respect of any one. shell snap at the master himself and as good as dares him to thrash her and the more hurt she gets the more venomous she grows.  at first on hearing this account from zillah i determined to leave my situation take a cottage and get catherine to come and live with me but mr. heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton in an independent house and i can see no remedy at present unless she could marry again and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange.         thus ended mrs. deans story. notwithstanding the doctors prophecy i am rapidly recovering strength and though it be only the second week in january i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two and riding over to wuthering heights to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london and if he likes he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october. i would not pass another winter here for much.     chapter xxxi   yesterday was bright calm and frosty. i went to the heights as i proposed my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady and i did not refuse for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request. the front door stood open but the jealous gate was fastened as at my last visit i knocked and invoked earnshaw from among the gardenbeds he unchained it and i entered. the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. i took particular notice of him this time but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.  i asked if mr. heathcliff were at home he answered no but he would be in at dinnertime. it was eleven oclock and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me in the office of watchdog not as a substitute for the host.  we entered together catherine was there making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first. she hardly raised her eyes to notice me and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before never returning my bow and goodmorning by the slightest acknowledgment.  she does not seem so amiable i thought as mrs. dean would persuade me to believe. shes a beauty it is true but not an angel.  earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. remove them yourself she said pushing them from her as soon as she had done and retiring to a stool by the window where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnipparings in her lap. i approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and as i fancied adroitly dropped mrs. deans note on to her knee unnoticed by haretonbut she asked aloud what is that and chucked it off.  a letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the grange i answered annoyed at her exposing my kind deed and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own. she would gladly have gathered it up at this information but hareton beat her he seized and put it in his waistcoat saying mr. heathcliff should look at it first. thereat catherine silently turned her face from us and very stealthily drew out her pockethandkerchief and applied it to her eyes and her cousin after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could. catherine caught and perused it eagerly then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates rational and irrational of her former home and gazing towards the hills murmured in soliloquy  i should like to be riding minny down there i should like to be climbing up there oh im tiredim stalled hareton and she leant her pretty head back against the sill with half a yawn and half a sigh and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her.  mrs. heathcliff i said after sitting some time mute you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours so intimate that i think it strange you wont come and speak to me. my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you and shell be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you except that you received her letter and said nothing  she appeared to wonder at this speech and asked  does ellen like you  yes very well i replied hesitatingly.  you must tell her she continued that i would answer her letter but i have no materials for writing not even a book from which i might tear a leaf.  no books i exclaimed. how do you contrive to live here without them if i may take the liberty to inquire. though provided with a large library im frequently very dull at the grange take my books away and i should be desperate  i was always reading when i had them said catherine and mr. heathcliff never reads so he took it into his head to destroy my books. i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. only once i searched through josephs store of theology to his great irritation and once hareton i came upon a secret stock in your roomsome latin and greek and some tales and poetry all old friends. i brought the last hereand you gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons for the mere love of stealing they are of no use to you or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall. perhaps your envy counselled mr. heathcliff to rob me of my treasures but ive most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart and you cannot deprive me of those  earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations.  mr. hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge i said coming to his rescue. he is not envious but emulous of your attainments. hell be a clever scholar in a few years.  and he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime answered catherine. yes i hear him trying to spell and read to himself and pretty blunders he makes i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday it was extremely funny. i heard you and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words and then cursing because you couldnt read their explanations  the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance and then laughed at for trying to remove it. i had a similar notion and remembering mrs. deans anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared i observedbut mrs. heathcliff we have each had a commencement and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us we should stumble and totter yet.  oh she replied i dont wish to limit his acquirements still he has no right to appropriate what is mine and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations those books both prose and verse are consecrated to me by other associations and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth besides of all he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat as if out of deliberate malice.  haretons chest heaved in silence a minute he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath which it was no easy task to suppress. i rose and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment took up my station in the doorway surveying the external prospect as i stood. he followed my example and left the room but presently reappeared bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands which he threw into catherines lap exclaimingtake them i never want to hear or read or think of them again  i wont have them now she answered. i shall connect them with you and hate them.  she opened one that had obviously been often turned over and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner then laughed and threw it from her. and listen she continued provokingly commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion.  but his selflove would endure no further torment i heard and not altogether disapprovingly a manual check given to her saucy tongue. the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousins sensitive though uncultivated feelings and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflictor. he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. i fancied that as they consumed he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and everincreasing pleasure he had anticipated from them and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also. he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments till catherine crossed his path. shame at her scorn and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result.  yes thats all the good that such a brute as you can get from them cried catherine sucking her damaged lip and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes.  youd better hold your tongue now he answered fiercely.  and his agitation precluded further speech he advanced hastily to the entrance where i made way for him to pass. but ere he had crossed the doorstones mr. heathcliff coming up the causeway encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder askedwhats to do now my lad  naught naught he said and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude.  heathcliff gazed after him and sighed.  it will be odd if i thwart myself he muttered unconscious that i was behind him. but when i look for his father in his face i find her every day more how the devil is he so like i can hardly bear to see him.  he bent his eyes to the ground and walked moodily in. there was a restless anxious expression in his countenance i had never remarked there before and he looked sparer in person. his daughterinlaw on perceiving him through the window immediately escaped to the kitchen so that i remained alone.  im glad to see you out of doors again mr. lockwood he said in reply to my greeting from selfish motives partly i dont think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation. ive wondered more than once what brought you here.  an idle whim i fear sir was my answer or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away. i shall set out for london next week and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it. i believe i shall not live there any more.  oh indeed youre tired of being banished from the world are you he said. but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you wont occupy your journey is useless i never relent in exacting my due from any one.  im coming to plead off nothing about it i exclaimed considerably irritated. should you wish it ill settle with you now and i drew my notebook from my pocket.  no no he replied coolly youll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts if you fail to return im not in such a hurry. sit down and take your dinner with us a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome. catherine bring the things in where are you  catherine reappeared bearing a tray of knives and forks.  you may get your dinner with joseph muttered heathcliff aside and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.  she obeyed his directions very punctually perhaps she had no temptation to transgress. living among clowns and misanthropists she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.  with mr. heathcliff grim and saturnine on the one hand and hareton absolutely dumb on the other i made a somewhat cheerless meal and bade adieu early. i would have departed by the back way to get a last glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph but hareton received orders to lead up my horse and my host himself escorted me to the door so i could not fulfil my wish.  how dreary life gets over in that house i reflected while riding down the road. what a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs. linton heathcliff had she and i struck up an attachment as her good nurse desired and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town     chapter xxxii   .this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton. the ostler at a roadside publichouse was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarkedyons frough gimmerton nah theyre allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest.  gimmerton i repeatedmy residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy. ah i know. how far is it from this  happen fourteen mile oer th hills and a rough road he answered.  a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange. it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn. besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again. having rested awhile i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours.  i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone. the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier. i distinguished a moorsheep cropping the short turf on the graves. it was sweet warm weathertoo warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august im sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes. in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath.  i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear. i rode into the court. under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the housesteps smoking a meditative pipe.  is mrs. dean within i demanded of the dame.  mistress dean nay she answered she doesnt bide here shoos up at th heights.  are you the housekeeper then i continued.  eea aw keep th hause she replied.  well im mr. lockwood the master. are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder i wish to stay all night.  t maister she cried in astonishment. whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word. theys nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place nowt there isnt  she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bade her be composed. i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sittingroom for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in. no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary. she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the hearthbrush into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a restingplace against my return. wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. an afterthought brought me back when i had quitted the court.  all well at the heights i inquired of the woman.  eea fr owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders.  i would have asked why mrs. dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in frontone fading and the other brighteningas i quitted the park and climbed the stony byroad branching off to mr. heathcliffs dwelling. before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon. i had neither to climb the gate nor to knockit yielded to my hand. that is an improvement i thought. and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruittrees.  both doors and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coaldistrict a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered.  contrary said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. that for the third time you dunce im not going to tell you again. recollect or ill pull your hair  contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones. and now kiss me for minding so well.  no read it over first correctly without a single mistake.  the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him. his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention. its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown locks as she bent to superintend his studies and her faceit was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady. i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty.  the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned. then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors. i supposed i should be condemned in hareton earnshaws heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents.  id rayther by th haulf hev em swearing i my lugs froh morn to neeght nor hearken ye hahsiver said the tenant of the kitchen in answer to an unheard speech of nellys. its a blazing shame that i cannot oppen t blessed book but yah set up them glories to sattan and all t flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th warld oh yere a raight nowt and shoos another and that poor lad ll be lost atween ye. poor lad he added with a groan hes witched im sartin ont. oh lord judge em for theres norther law nor justice among wer rullers  no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer. but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me. this is fairy annies weddinga bonny tuneit goes to a dance.  mrs. dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognising me directly she jumped to her feet cryingwhy bless you mr. lockwood how could you think of returning in this way alls shut up at thrushcross grange. you should have given us notice  ive arranged to be accommodated there for as long as i shall stay i answered. i depart again tomorrow. and how are you transplanted here mrs. dean tell me that.  zillah left and mr. heathcliff wished me to come soon after you went to london and stay till you returned. but step in pray have you walked from gimmerton this evening  from the grange i replied and while they make me lodging room there i want to finish my business with your master because i dont think of having another opportunity in a hurry.  what business sir said nelly conducting me into the house. hes gone out at present and wont return soon.  about the rent i answered.  oh then it is with mrs. heathcliff you must settle she observed or rather with me. she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet and i act for her theres nobody else.  i looked surprised.  ah you have not heard of heathcliffs death i see she continued.  heathcliff dead i exclaimed astonished. how long ago  three months since but sit down and let me take your hat and ill tell you all about it. stop you have had nothing to eat have you  i want nothing i have ordered supper at home. you sit down too. i never dreamt of his dying let me hear how it came to pass. you say you dont expect them back for some timethe young people  noi have to scold them every evening for their late rambles but they dont care for me. at least have a drink of our old ale it will do you good you seem weary.  she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse and i heard joseph asking whether it warnt a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life and then to get them jocks out o t maisters cellar he fair shaamed to bide still and see it.  she did not stay to retaliate but reentered in a minute bearing a reaming silver pint whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness. and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of heathcliffs history. he had a queer end as she expressed it.         i was summoned to wuthering heights within a fortnight of your leaving us she said and i obeyed joyfully for catherines sake. my first interview with her grieved and shocked me she had altered so much since our separation. mr. heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here he only told me he wanted me and he was tired of seeing catherine i must make the little parlour my sittingroom and keep her with me. it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day. she seemed pleased at this arrangement and by degrees i smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her amusement at the grange and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. the delusion did not last long. catherine contented at first in a brief space grew irritable and restless. for one thing she was forbidden to move out of the garden and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on for another in following the house i was forced to quit her frequently and she complained of loneliness she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude. i did not mind their skirmishes but hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also when the master wanted to have the house to himself and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach or quietly joined in my occupations and shunned remarking or addressing himand though he was always as sullen and silent as possibleafter a while she changed her behaviour and became incapable of letting him alone talking at him commenting on his stupidity and idleness expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he livedhow he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing.  hes just like a dog is he not ellen she once observed or a carthorse he does his work eats his food and sleeps eternally what a blank dreary mind he must have do you ever dream hareton and if you do what is it about but you cant speak to me  then she looked at him but he would neither open his mouth nor look again.  hes perhaps dreaming now she continued. he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers. ask him ellen.  mr. hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs if you dont behave i said. he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist as if tempted to use it.  i know why hareton never speaks when i am in the kitchen she exclaimed on another occasion. he is afraid i shall laugh at him. ellen what do you think he began to teach himself to read once and because i laughed he burned his books and dropped it was he not a fool  were not you naughty i said answer me that.  perhaps i was she went on but i did not expect him to be so silly. hareton if i gave you a book would you take it now ill try  she placed one she had been perusing on his hand he flung it off and muttered if she did not give over he would break her neck.  well i shall put it here she said in the tabledrawer and im going to bed.  then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it and departed. but he would not come near it and so i informed her in the morning to her great disappointment. i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself she had done it effectually. but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury while i ironed or pursued other such stationary employments as i could not well do in the parlour she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. when hareton was there she generally paused in an interesting part and left the book lying about that she did repeatedly but he was as obstinate as a mule and instead of snatching at her bait in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph and they sat like automatons one on each side of the fire the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense as he would have called it the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it. on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions and catherine yawned and sighed and teased me to talk to her and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living her life was useless.  mr. heathcliff who grew more and more disinclined to society had almost banished earnshaw from his apartment. owing to an accident at the commencement of march he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen. his gun burst while out on the hills by himself a splinter cut his arm and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home. the consequence was that perforce he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made it up again. it suited catherine to have him there at any rate it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever and she would compel me to find out business below that she might accompany me.  on easter monday joseph went to gimmerton fair with some cattle and in the afternoon i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. earnshaw sat morose as usual at the chimney corner and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the windowpanes varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs and whispered ejaculations and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin who steadfastly smoked and looked into the grate. at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light she removed to the hearthstone. i bestowed little attention on her proceedings but presently i heard her beginive found out hareton that i wantthat im gladthat i should like you to be my cousin now if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough.  hareton returned no answer.  hareton hareton hareton do you hear she continued.  get off wi ye he growled with uncompromising gruffness.  let me take that pipe she said cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth.  before he could attempt to recover it it was broken and behind the fire. he swore at her and seized another.  stop she cried you must listen to me first and i cant speak while those clouds are floating in my face.  will you go to the devil he exclaimed ferociously and let me be  no she persisted i wont i cant tell what to do to make you talk to me and you are determined not to understand. when i call you stupid i dont mean anything i dont mean that i despise you. come you shall take notice of me hareton you are my cousin and you shall own me.  i shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride and your damned mocking tricks he answered. ill go to hell body and soul before i look sideways after you again. side out o t gate now this minute  catherine frowned and retreated to the windowseat chewing her lip and endeavouring by humming an eccentric tune to conceal a growing tendency to sob.  you should be friends with your cousin mr. hareton i interrupted since she repents of her sauciness. it would do you a great deal of good it would make you another man to have her for a companion.  a companion he cried when she hates me and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon nay if it made me a king id not be scorned for seeking her goodwill any more.  it is not i who hate you it is you who hate me wept cathy no longer disguising her trouble. you hate me as much as mr. heathcliff does and more.  youre a damned liar began earnshaw why have i made him angry by taking your part then a hundred times and that when you sneered at and despised me andgo on plaguing me and ill step in yonder and say you worried me out of the kitchen  i didnt know you took my part she answered drying her eyes and i was miserable and bitter at everybody but now i thank you and beg you to forgive me what can i do besides  she returned to the hearth and frankly extended her hand. he blackened and scowled like a thundercloud and kept his fists resolutely clenched and his gaze fixed on the ground. catherine by instinct must have divined it was obdurate perversity and not dislike that prompted this dogged conduct for after remaining an instant undecided she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. the little rogue thought i had not seen her and drawing back she took her former station by the window quite demurely. i shook my head reprovingly and then she blushed and whisperedwell what should i have done ellen he wouldnt shake hands and he wouldnt look i must show him some way that i like himthat i want to be friends.  whether the kiss convinced hareton i cannot tell he was very careful for some minutes that his face should not be seen and when he did raise it he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.  catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper and having tied it with a bit of ribbon and addressed it to mr. hareton earnshaw she desired me to be her ambassadress and convey the present to its destined recipient.  and tell him if hell take it ill come and teach him to read it right she said and if he refuse it ill go upstairs and never tease him again.  i carried it and repeated the message anxiously watched by my employer. hareton would not open his fingers so i laid it on his knee. he did not strike it off either. i returned to my work. catherine leaned her head and arms on the table till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed then she stole away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin. he trembled and his face glowed all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him he could not summon courage at first to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition.  say you forgive me hareton do. you can make me so happy by speaking that little word.  he muttered something inaudible.  and youll be my friend added catherine interrogatively.  nay youll be ashamed of me every day of your life he answered and the more ashamed the more you know me and i cannot bide it.  so you wont be my friend she said smiling as sweet as honey and creeping close up.  i overheard no further distinguishable talk but on looking round again i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides and the enemies were thenceforth sworn allies.  the work they studied was full of costly pictures and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home. he poor man was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine seated on the same bench with hareton earnshaw leaning her hand on his shoulder and confounded at his favourites endurance of her proximity it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night. his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table and overlaid it with dirty banknotes from his pocketbook the produce of the days transactions. at length he summoned hareton from his seat.  tak these in to t maister lad he said and bide there. is gang up to my own rahm. this hoiles neither mensful nor seemly for us we mun side out and seearch another.  come catherine i said we must side out too ive done my ironing. are you ready to go  it is not eight oclock she answered rising unwillingly. hareton ill leave this book upon the chimneypiece and ill bring some more tomorrow.  ony books that yah leave i shall tak into th hahse said joseph and itll be mitch if yah find em agean soa yah may plase yerseln  cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers and smiling as she passed hareton went singing upstairs lighter of heart i venture to say than ever she had been under that roof before except perhaps during her earliest visits to linton.  the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly though it encountered temporary interruptions. earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish and my young lady was no philosopher and no paragon of patience but both their minds tending to the same pointone loving and desiring to esteem and the other loving and desiring to be esteemedthey contrived in the end to reach it.  you see mr. lockwood it was easy enough to win mrs. heathcliffs heart. but now im glad you did not try. the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two. i shall envy no one on their wedding day there wont be a happier woman than myself in england     chapter xxxiii   on the morrow of that monday earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments and therefore remaining about the house i speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me as heretofore. she got downstairs before me and out into the garden where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work and when i went to bid them come to breakfast i saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the grange.  i was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief halfhour the blackcurrant trees were the apple of josephs eye and she had just fixed her choice of a flowerbed in the midst of them.  there that will be all shown to the master i exclaimed the minute it is discovered. and what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden we shall have a fine explosion on the head of it see if we dont mr. hareton i wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding  id forgotten they were josephs answered earnshaw rather puzzled but ill tell him i did it.  we always ate our meals with mr. heathcliff. i held the mistresss post in making tea and carving so i was indispensable at table. catherine usually sat by me but today she stole nearer to hareton and i presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility.  now mind you dont talk with and notice your cousin too much were my whispered instructions as we entered the room. it will certainly annoy mr. heathcliff and hell be mad at you both.  im not going to she answered.  the minute after she had sidled to him and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge.  he dared not speak to her there he dared hardly look and yet she went on teasing till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh. i frowned and then she glanced towards the master whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company as his countenance evinced and she grew serious for an instant scrutinizing him with deep gravity. afterwards she turned and recommenced her nonsense at last hareton uttered a smothered laugh. mr. heathcliff started his eye rapidly surveyed our faces. catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance which he abhorred.  it is well you are out of my reach he exclaimed. what fiend possesses you to stare back at me continually with those infernal eyes down with them and dont remind me of your existence again. i thought i had cured you of laughing.  it was me muttered hareton.  what do you say demanded the master.  hareton looked at his plate and did not repeat the confession. mr. heathcliff looked at him a bit and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing. we had nearly finished and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder so i anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting when joseph appeared at the door revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected. he must have seen cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud and rendered his speech difficult to understand he began  i mun hev my wage and i mun goa i hed aimed to dee wheare id sarved fur sixty year and i thowt id lug my books up into t garret and all my bits o stuff and they sud hev t kitchen to theirseln for t sake o quietness. it wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun but i thowt i could do that but nah shoos taan my garden fro me and by th heart maister i cannot stand it yah may bend to th yoak an ye willi noan used to t and an old man doesnt sooin get used to new barthens. id rayther arn my bite an my sup wi a hammer in th road  now now idiot interrupted heathcliff cut it short whats your grievance ill interfere in no quarrels between you and nelly. she may thrust you into the coalhole for anything i care.  its noan nelly answered joseph. i sudnt shift for nellynasty ill nowt as shoo is. thank god shoo cannot stale t sowl o nobdy shoo wer niver soa handsome but what a body mud look at her bout winking. its yon flaysome graceless quean thats witched our lad wi her bold een and her forrard waystillnay it fair brusts my heart hes forgotten all ive done for him and made on him and goan and riven up a whole row o t grandest curranttrees i t garden and here he lamented outright unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries and earnshaws ingratitude and dangerous condition.  is the fool drunk asked mr. heathcliff. hareton is it you hes finding fault with  ive pulled up two or three bushes replied the young man but im going to set em again.  and why have you pulled them up said the master.  catherine wisely put in her tongue.  we wanted to plant some flowers there she cried. im the only person to blame for i wished him to do it.  and who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place demanded her fatherinlaw much surprised. and who ordered you to obey her he added turning to hareton.  the latter was speechless his cousin repliedyou shouldnt grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land  your land insolent slut you never had any said heathcliff.  and my money she continued returning his angry glare and meantime biting a piece of crust the remnant of her breakfast.  silence he exclaimed. get done and begone  and haretons land and his money pursued the reckless thing. hareton and i are friends now and i shall tell him all about you  the master seemed confounded a moment he grew pale and rose up eyeing her all the while with an expression of mortal hate.  if you strike me hareton will strike you she said so you may as well sit down.  if hareton does not turn you out of the room ill strike him to hell thundered heathcliff. damnable witch dare you pretend to rouse him against me off with her do you hear fling her into the kitchen ill kill her ellen dean if you let her come into my sight again  hareton tried under his breath to persuade her to go.  drag her away he cried savagely. are you staying to talk and he approached to execute his own command.  hell not obey you wicked man any more said catherine and hell soon detest you as much as i do.  wisht wisht muttered the young man reproachfully i will not hear you speak so to him. have done.  but you wont let him strike me she cried.  come then he whispered earnestly.  it was too late heathcliff had caught hold of her.  now you go he said to earnshaw. accursed witch this time she has provoked me when i could not bear it and ill make her repent it for ever  he had his hand in her hair hareton attempted to release her locks entreating him not to hurt her that once. heathcliffs black eyes flashed he seemed ready to tear catherine in pieces and i was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue when of a sudden his fingers relaxed he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm and gazed intently in her face. then he drew his hand over his eyes stood a moment to collect himself apparently and turning anew to catherine said with assumed calmnessyou must learn to avoid putting me in a passion or i shall really murder you some time go with mrs. dean and keep with her and confine your insolence to her ears. as to hareton earnshaw if i see him listen to you ill send him seeking his bread where he can get it your love will make him an outcast and a beggar. nelly take her and leave me all of you leave me  i led my young lady out she was too glad of her escape to resist the other followed and mr. heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. i had counselled catherine to dine upstairs but as soon as he perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her. he spoke to none of us ate very little and went out directly afterwards intimating that he should not return before evening.  the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence where i heard hareton sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her fatherinlaws conduct to his father. he said he wouldnt suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement if he were the devil it didnt signify he would stand by him and hed rather she would abuse himself as she used to than begin on mr. heathcliff. catherine was waxing cross at this but he found means to make her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father then she comprehended that earnshaw took the masters reputation home to himself and was attached by ties stronger than reason could breakchains forged by habit which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen. she showed a good heart thenceforth in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning heathcliff and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton indeed i dont believe she has ever breathed a syllable in the latters hearing against her oppressor since.  when this slight disagreement was over they were friends again and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. i came in to sit with them after i had done my work and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them that i did not notice how time got on. you know they both appeared in a measure my children i had long been proud of one and now i was sure the other would be a source of equal satisfaction. his honest warm and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred and catherines sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry. his brightening mind brightened his features and added spirit and nobility to their aspect i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights after her expedition to the crags. while i admired and they laboured dusk drew on and with it returned the master. he came upon us quite unexpectedly entering by the front way and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our heads to glance at him. well i reflected there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight and it will be a burning shame to scold them. the red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children for though he was twentythree and she eighteen each had so much of novelty to feel and learn that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.  they lifted their eyes together to encounter mr. heathcliff perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar and they are those of catherine earnshaw. the present catherine has no other likeness to her except a breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty whether she will or not. with hareton the resemblance is carried farther it is singular at all times then it was particularly striking because his senses were alert and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr. heathcliff he walked to the hearth in evident agitation but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man or i should say altered its character for it was there yet. he took the book from his hand and glanced at the open page then returned it without any observation merely signing catherine away her companion lingered very little behind her and i was about to depart also but he bid me sit still.  it is a poor conclusion is it not he observed having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed an absurd termination to my violent exertions i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses and train myself to be capable of working like hercules and when everything is ready and in my power i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished my old enemies have not beaten me now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives i could do it and none could hinder me. but where is the use i dont care for striking i cant take the trouble to raise my hand that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. it is far from being the case i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction and i am too idle to destroy for nothing.  nelly there is a strange change approaching im in its shadow at present. i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink. those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me and that appearance causes me pain amounting to agony. about her i wont speak and i dont desire to think but i earnestly wish she were invisible her presence invokes only maddening sensations. he moves me differently and yet if i could do it without seeming insane id never see him again youll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so he added making an effort to smile if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies. but youll not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.  five minutes ago hareton seemed a personification of my youth not a human being i felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. in the first place his startling likeness to catherine connected him fearfully with her. that however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination is actually the least for what is not connected with her to me and what does not recall her i cannot look down to this floor but her features are shaped in the flags in every cloud in every treefilling the air at night and caught by glimpses in every object by dayi am surrounded with her image the most ordinary faces of men and womenmy own featuresmock me with a resemblance. the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her well haretons aspect was the ghost of my immortal love of my wild endeavours to hold my right my degradation my pride my happiness and my anguish  but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you only it will let you know why with a reluctance to be always alone his society is no benefit rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together. i can give them no attention any more.  but what do you mean by a change mr. heathcliff i said alarmed at his manner though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining odd fancies. he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine.  i shall not know that till it comes he said im only half conscious of it now.  you have no feeling of illness have you i asked.  no nelly i have not he answered.  then you are not afraid of death i pursued.  afraid no he replied. i have neither a fear nor a presentiment nor a hope of death. why should i with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living and unperilous occupations i ought to and probably shall remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head. and yet i cannot continue in this condition i have to remind myself to breathealmost to remind my heart to beat and it is like bending back a stiff spring it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead which is not associated with one universal idea. i have a single wish and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it. they have yearned towards it so long and so unwaveringly that im convinced it will be reachedand soonbecause it has devoured my existence i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment. my confessions have not relieved me but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show. o god it is a long fight i wish it were over  he began to pace the room muttering terrible things to himself till i was inclined to believe as he said joseph did that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell. i wondered greatly how it would end. though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind even by looks it was his habitual mood i had no doubt he asserted it himself but not a soul from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact. you did not when you saw him mr. lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then only fonder of continued solitude and perhaps still more laconic in company.     chapter xxxiv   for some days after that evening mr. heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton and cathy. he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings choosing rather to absent himself and eating once in twentyfour hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him.  one night after the family were in bed i heard him go downstairs and out at the front door. i did not hear him reenter and in the morning i found he was still away. we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as showers and sun could make it and the two dwarf appletrees near the southern wall in full bloom. after breakfast catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the firtrees at the end of the house and she beguiled hareton who had perfectly recovered from his accident to dig and arrange her little garden which was shifted to that corner by the influence of josephs complaints. i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around and the beautiful soft blue overhead when my young lady who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border returned only half laden and informed us that mr. heathcliff was coming in. and he spoke to me she added with a perplexed countenance.  what did he say asked hareton.  he told me to begone as fast as i could she answered. but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him.  how he inquired.  why almost bright and cheerful. no almost nothingvery much excited and wild and glad she replied.  nightwalking amuses him then i remarked affecting a careless manner in reality as surprised as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master looking glad would not be an everyday spectacle. i framed an excuse to go in. heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembled yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes that altered the aspect of his whole face.  will you have some breakfast i said. you must be hungry rambling about all night i wanted to discover where he had been but i did not like to ask directly.  no im not hungry he answered averting his head and speaking rather contemptuously as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.  i felt perplexed i didnt know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.  i dont think it right to wander out of doors i observed instead of being in bed it is not wise at any rate this moist season. i daresay youll catch a bad cold or a fever you have something the matter with you now  nothing but what i can bear he replied and with the greatest pleasure provided youll leave me alone get in and dont annoy me.  i obeyed and in passing i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.  yes i reflected to myself we shall have a fit of illness. i cannot conceive what he has been doing.  that noon he sat down to dinner with us and received a heapedup plate from my hands as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.  ive neither cold nor fever nelly he remarked in allusion to my mornings speech and im ready to do justice to the food you give me.  he took his knife and fork and was going to commence eating when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. he laid them on the table looked eagerly towards the window then rose and went out. we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal and earnshaw said hed go and ask why he would not dine he thought we had grieved him some way.  well is he coming cried catherine when her cousin returned.  nay he answered but hes not angry he seemed rarely pleased indeed only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else.  i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he reentered when the room was clear in no degree calmer the same unnaturalit was unnaturalappearance of joy under his black brows the same bloodless hue and his teeth visible now and then in a kind of smile his frame shivering not as one shivers with chill or weakness but as a tightstretched cord vibratesa strong thrilling rather than trembling.  i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaimedhave you heard any good news mr. heathcliff you look uncommonly animated.  where should good news come from to me he said. im animated with hunger and seemingly i must not eat.  your dinner is here i returned why wont you get it  i dont want it now he muttered hastily ill wait till supper. and nelly once for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away from me. i wish to be troubled by nobody i wish to have this place to myself.  is there some new reason for this banishment i inquired. tell me why you are so queer mr. heathcliff where were you last night im not putting the question through idle curiosity but  you are putting the question through very idle curiosity he interrupted with a laugh. yet ill answer it. last night i was on the threshold of hell. today i am within sight of my heaven. i have my eyes on it hardly three feet to sever me and now youd better go youll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying.  having swept the hearth and wiped the table i departed more perplexed than ever.  he did not quit the house again that afternoon and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight oclock i deemed it proper though unsummoned to carry a candle and his supper to him. he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice but not looking out his face was turned to the interior gloom. the fire had smouldered to ashes the room was filled with the damp mild air of the cloudy evening and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguishable but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles or through the large stones which it could not cover. i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate and commenced shutting the casements one after another till i came to his.  must i close this i asked in order to rouse him for he would not stir.  the light flashed on his features as i spoke. oh mr. lockwood i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view those deep black eyes that smile and ghastly paleness it appeared to me not mr. heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candle bend towards the wall and it left me in darkness.  yes close it he replied in his familiar voice. there that is pure awkwardness why did you hold the candle horizontally be quick and bring another.  i hurried out in a foolish state of dread and said to josephthe master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire. for i dared not go in myself again just then.  joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immediately with the suppertray in his other hand explaining that mr. heathcliff was going to bed and he wanted nothing to eat till morning. we heard him mount the stairs directly he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber but turned into that with the panelled bed its window as i mentioned before is wide enough for anybody to get through and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion of which he had rather we had no suspicion.  is he a ghoul or a vampire i mused. i had read of such hideous incarnate demons. and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy and watched him grow to youth and followed him almost through his whole course and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror. but where did he come from the little dark thing harboured by a good man to his bane muttered superstition as i dozed into unconsciousness. and i began half dreaming to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him and repeating my waking meditations i tracked his existence over again with grim variations at last picturing his death and funeral of which all i can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument and consulting the sexton about it and as he had no surname and we could not tell his age we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word heathcliff. that came true we were. if you enter the kirkyard youll read on his headstone only that and the date of his death.  dawn restored me to common sense. i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window. there were none. he has stayed at home i thought and hell be all right today. i prepared breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton and catherine to get theirs ere the master came down for he lay late. they preferred taking it out of doors under the trees and i set a little table to accommodate them.  on my reentrance i found mr. heathcliff below. he and joseph were conversing about some farming business he gave clear minute directions concerning the matter discussed but he spoke rapidly and turned his head continually aside and had the same excited expression even more exaggerated. when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose and i put a basin of coffee before him. he drew it nearer and then rested his arms on the table and looked at the opposite wall as i supposed surveying one particular portion up and down with glittering restless eyes and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.  come now i exclaimed pushing some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been waiting near an hour.  he didnt notice me and yet he smiled. id rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.  mr. heathcliff master i cried dont for gods sake stare as if you saw an unearthly vision.  dont for gods sake shout so loud he replied. turn round and tell me are we by ourselves  of course was my answer of course we are.  still i involuntarily obeyed him as if i was not quite sure. with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.  now i perceived he was not looking at the wall for when i regarded him alone it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance. and whatever it was it communicated apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes at least the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea. the fancied object was not fixed either his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence and even in speaking to me were never weaned away. i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread his fingers clenched before they reached it and remained on the table forgetful of their aim.  i sat a model of patience trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable and got up asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals and saying that on the next occasion i neednt wait i might set the things down and go. having uttered these words he left the house slowly sauntered down the garden path and disappeared through the gate.  the hours crept anxiously by another evening came. i did not retire to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep. he returned after midnight and instead of going to bed shut himself into the room beneath. i listened and tossed about and finally dressed and descended. it was too irksome to lie there harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.  i distinguished mr. heathcliffs step restlessly measuring the floor and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan. he muttered detached words also the only one i could catch was the name of catherine coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul. i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment but i desired to divert him from his reverie and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire stirred it and began to scrape the cinders. it drew him forth sooner than i expected. he opened the door immediately and saidnelly come hereis it morning come in with your light.  it is striking four i answered. you want a candle to take upstairs you might have lit one at this fire.  no i dont wish to go upstairs he said. come in and kindle me a fire and do anything there is to do about the room.  i must blow the coals red first before i can carry any i replied getting a chair and the bellows.  he roamed to and fro meantime in a state approaching distraction his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between.  when day breaks ill send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters and while i can act calmly. i have not written my will yet and how to leave my property i cannot determine. i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth.  i would not talk so mr. heathcliff i interposed. let your will be a while youll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet i never expected that your nerves would be disordered they are at present marvellously so however and almost entirely through your own fault. the way youve passed these three last days might knock up a titan. do take some food and some repose. you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both. your cheeks are hollow and your eyes bloodshot like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.  it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied. i assure you it is through no settled designs. ill do both as soon as i possibly can. but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms length of the shore i must reach it first and then ill rest. well never mind mr. green as to repenting of my injustices ive done no injustice and i repent of nothing. im too happy and yet im not happy enough. my souls bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself.  happy master i cried. strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier.  what is that he asked. give it.  you are aware mr. heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period. you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now. could it be hurtful to send for some onesome minister of any denomination it does not matter whichto explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die  im rather obliged than angry nelly he said for you remind me of the manner in which i desire to be buried. it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening. you and hareton may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins no minister need come nor need anything be said over me.i tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.  and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk i said shocked at his godless indifference. how would you like it  they wont do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated  as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer. but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him. i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone.  i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof. then turning to catherine who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half sneeringlywill you come chuck ill not hurt you. no to you ive made myself worse than the devil. well there is one who wont shrink from my company by god shes relentless. oh damn it its unutterably too much for flesh and blood to beareven mine.  he solicited the society of no one more. at dusk he went into his chamber. through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself. hareton was anxious to enter but i bid him fetch mr. kenneth and he should go in and see him. when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and heathcliff bid us be damned. he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away.  the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till daydawn and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the masters window swinging open and the rain driving straight in. he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through. he must either be up or out. but ill make no more ado ill go boldly and look.  having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in. mr. heathcliff was therelaid on his back. his eyes met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile. i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bedclothes dripped and he was perfectly still. the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark  i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes to extinguish if possible that frightful lifelike gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph. joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him.  th divils harried off his soul he cried and he may hev his carcass into t bargin for aught i care ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery. i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hands and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights.  i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. but poor hareton the most wronged was the only one who really suffered much. he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest. he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel.  mr. kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died. i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause.  we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished. earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance. the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered. hareton with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion moundsand i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. but the country folks if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even within this house. idle tales youll say and so say i. yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his deathand an odd thing happened to me about a month ago. i was going to the grange one eveninga dark evening threatening thunderand just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided.  what is the matter my little man i asked.  theres heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em.  i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down. he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat. yet still i dont like being out in the dark now and i dont like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange.  they are going to the grange then i said.  yes answered mrs. dean as soon as they are married and that will be on new years day.  and who will live here then  why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company. they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up.  for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it i observed.  no mr. lockwood said nelly shaking her head. i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity.  at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning.  they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window. together they would brave satan and all his legions.  as they stepped on to the doorstones and halted to take a last look at the moonor more correctly at each other by her lighti felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs. dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the housedoor and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his fellowservants gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.  my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk. when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.  i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in heath edgar lintons only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot heathcliffs still bare.  i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
