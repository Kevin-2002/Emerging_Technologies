This is certainly a beautiful\ncountry! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a\nsituation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect\nmisanthropist\u2019s Heaven\u2014and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable\npair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little\nimagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes\nwithdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his\nfingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further\nin his waistcoat, as I announced my name.\n\n\u201cMr. Heathcliff?\u201d I said.\n\nA nod was the answer.\n\n\u201cMr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling\nas soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have\nnot inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation\nof Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThrushcross Grange is my own, sir,\u201d he interrupted, wincing. \u201cI should\nnot allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it\u2014walk in!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwalk in\u201d was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the\nsentiment, \u201cGo to the Deuce!\u201d even the gate over which he leant\nmanifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that\ncircumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested\nin a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\n\nWhen he saw my horse\u2019s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put\nout his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the\ncauseway, calling, as we entered the court,\u2014\u201cJoseph, take Mr.\nLockwood\u2019s horse; and bring up some wine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,\u201d was the\nreflection suggested by this compound order. \u201cNo wonder the grass grows\nup between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.\u201d\n\nJoseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale\nand sinewy. \u201cThe Lord help us!\u201d he soliloquised in an undertone of\npeevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\nin my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\ndivine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\nreference to my unexpected advent.\n\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s dwelling. \u201cWuthering\u201d\nbeing a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the\natmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\nPure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:\none may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by\nthe excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and\nby a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if\ncraving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build\nit strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the\ncorners defended with large jutting stones.\n\nBefore passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of\ngrotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the\nprincipal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins\nand shameless little boys, I detected the date \u201c1500,\u201d and the name\n\u201cHareton Earnshaw.\u201d I would have made a few comments, and requested a\nshort history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at\nthe door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,\nand I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting\nthe penetralium.\n\nOne step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\nintroductory lobby or passage: they call it here \u201cthe house\u201d\npre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I\nbelieve at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat\naltogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of\ntongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I\nobserved no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge\nfireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on\nthe walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat\nfrom ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and\ntankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very\nroof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay\nbare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with\noatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.\nAbove the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of\nhorse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters\ndisposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the\nchairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two\nheavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser\nreposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of\nsquealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.\n\nThe apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\nbelonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,\nand stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.\nSuch an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on\nthe round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six\nmiles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But\nMr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of\nliving. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a\ngentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:\nrather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,\nbecause he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.\nPossibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred\npride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of\nthe sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to\nshowy displays of feeling\u2014to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He\u2019ll\nlove and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of\nimpertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I\u2019m running on too fast: I\nbestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have\nentirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he\nmeets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope\nmy constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should\nnever have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself\nperfectly unworthy of one.\n\nWhile enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\ninto the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\neyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I \u201cnever told my love\u201d\nvocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\nguessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked\na return\u2014the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I\nconfess it with shame\u2014shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\nglance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was\nled to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her\nsupposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.\n\nBy this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of\ndeliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.\n\nI took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\nmy landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by\nattempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and\nwas sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and\nher white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,\nguttural gnarl.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better let the dog alone,\u201d growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\nchecking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. \u201cShe\u2019s not\naccustomed to be spoiled\u2014not kept for a pet.\u201d Then, striding to a side\ndoor, he shouted again, \u201cJoseph!\u201d\n\nJoseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\nintimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n_vis-\u00e0-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\nwho shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not\nanxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,\nimagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately\nindulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my\nphysiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and\nleapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the\ntable between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen\nfour-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens\nto the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects\nof assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I\ncould with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance\nfrom some of the household in re-establishing peace.\n\nMr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\nphlegm: I don\u2019t think they moved one second faster than usual, though\nthe hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an\ninhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with\ntucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\nmidst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\ntongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she\nonly remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master\nentered on the scene.\n\n\u201cWhat the devil is the matter?\u201d he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\ncould ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.\n\n\u201cWhat the devil, indeed!\u201d I muttered. \u201cThe herd of possessed swine\ncould have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,\nsir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t meddle with persons who touch nothing,\u201d he remarked,\nputting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. \u201cThe\ndogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bitten, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.\u201d Heathcliff\u2019s\ncountenance relaxed into a grin.\n\n\u201cCome, come,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a\nlittle wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\ndogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your\nhealth, sir?\u201d\n\nI bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\nfoolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,\nI felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since\nhis humour took that turn. He\u2014probably swayed by prudential\nconsideration of the folly of offending a good tenant\u2014relaxed a little\nin the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,\nand introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,\u2014a\ndiscourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of\nretirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and\nbefore I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another\nvisit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I\nshall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself\ncompared with him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nYesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend\nit by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to\nWuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.\u2014I dine\nbetween twelve and one o\u2019clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken\nas a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend\nmy request that I might be served at five)\u2014on mounting the stairs with\nthis lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl\non her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an\ninfernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.\nThis spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a\nfour-miles\u2019 walk, arrived at Heathcliff\u2019s garden-gate just in time to\nescape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.\n\nOn that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the\nair made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the\nchain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered\nwith straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till\nmy knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.\n\n\u201cWretched inmates!\u201d I ejaculated, mentally, \u201cyou deserve perpetual\nisolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,\nI would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don\u2019t care\u2014I will\nget in!\u201d So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.\nVinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the\nbarn.\n\n\u201cWhat are ye for?\u201d he shouted. \u201cT\u2019 maister\u2019s down i\u2019 t\u2019 fowld. Go round\nby th\u2019 end o\u2019 t\u2019 laith, if ye went to spake to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there nobody inside to open the door?\u201d I hallooed, responsively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobbut t\u2019 missis; and shoo\u2019ll not oppen \u2019t an ye mak\u2019 yer\nflaysome dins till neeght.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?\u201d\n\n\u201cNor-ne me! I\u2019ll hae no hend wi\u2019t,\u201d muttered the head, vanishing.\n\nThe snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another\ntrial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\nappeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after\nmarching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\npump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\napartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the\nradiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and\nnear the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to\nobserve the \u201cmissis,\u201d an individual whose existence I had never\npreviously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me\ntake a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained\nmotionless and mute.\n\n\u201cRough weather!\u201d I remarked. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door\nmust bear the consequence of your servants\u2019 leisure attendance: I had\nhard work to make them hear me.\u201d\n\nShe never opened her mouth. I stared\u2014she stared also: at any rate, she\nkept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\nembarrassing and disagreeable.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said the young man, gruffly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in soon.\u201d\n\nI obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\nsecond interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of\nowning my acquaintance.\n\n\u201cA beautiful animal!\u201d I commenced again. \u201cDo you intend parting with\nthe little ones, madam?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not mine,\u201d said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\nHeathcliff himself could have replied.\n\n\u201cAh, your favourites are among these?\u201d I continued, turning to an\nobscure cushion full of something like cats.\n\n\u201cA strange choice of favourites!\u201d she observed scornfully.\n\nUnluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew\ncloser to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\nevening.\n\n\u201cYou should not have come out,\u201d she said, rising and reaching from the\nchimney-piece two of the painted canisters.\n\nHer position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\nview of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and\napparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\nexquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\nsmall features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\nloose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\nexpression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\nsusceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between\nscorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected\nthere. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to\naid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted\nto assist him in counting his gold.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your help,\u201d she snapped; \u201cI can get them for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d I hastened to reply.\n\n\u201cWere you asked to tea?\u201d she demanded, tying an apron over her neat\nblack frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the\npot.\n\n\u201cI shall be glad to have a cup,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cWere you asked?\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, half smiling. \u201cYou are the proper person to ask me.\u201d\n\nShe flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\nher forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a\nchild\u2019s ready to cry.\n\nMeanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\nupper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on\nme from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\nmortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a\nservant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\nthe superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\ncurls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly\nover his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common\nlabourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed\nnone of a domestic\u2019s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.\nIn the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to\nabstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes\nafterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,\nfrom my uncomfortable state.\n\n\u201cYou see, sir, I am come, according to promise!\u201d I exclaimed, assuming\nthe cheerful; \u201cand I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if\nyou can afford me shelter during that space.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf an hour?\u201d he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; \u201cI\nwonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.\nDo you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People\nfamiliar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\ncan tell you there is no chance of a change at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\nGrange till morning\u2014could you spare me one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I could not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmph!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to mak\u2019 the tea?\u201d demanded he of the shabby coat,\nshifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.\n\n\u201cIs _he_ to have any?\u201d she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cGet it ready, will you?\u201d was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\nstarted. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\nnature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.\nWhen the preparations were finished, he invited me with\u2014\u201cNow, sir,\nbring forward your chair.\u201d And we all, including the rustic youth, drew\nround the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our\nmeal.\n\nI thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort\nto dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it\nwas impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal\nscowl they wore was their every-day countenance.\n\n\u201cIt is strange,\u201d I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea\nand receiving another\u2014\u201cit is strange how custom can mould our tastes\nand ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life\nof such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;\nyet, I\u2019ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with\nyour amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy amiable lady!\u201d he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on\nhis face. \u201cWhere is she\u2014my amiable lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes\u2014oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of\nministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even\nwhen her body is gone. Is that it?\u201d\n\nPerceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have\nseen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\nmake it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a\nperiod of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of\nbeing married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace\nof our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.\n\nThen it flashed upon me\u2014\u201cThe clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea\nout of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her\nhusband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being\nburied alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer\nignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity\u2014I must beware how\nI cause her to regret her choice.\u201d The last reflection may seem\nconceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on\nrepulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.\n\n\u201cMrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,\u201d said Heathcliff, corroborating\nmy surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\nlook of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles\nthat will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of\nhis soul.\n\n\u201cAh, certainly\u2014I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\nbeneficent fairy,\u201d I remarked, turning to my neighbour.\n\nThis was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\nfist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to\nrecollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\nmuttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.\n\n\u201cUnhappy in your conjectures, sir,\u201d observed my host; \u201cwe neither of us\nhave the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said\nshe was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this young man is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my son, assuredly.\u201d\n\nHeathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to\nattribute the paternity of that bear to him.\n\n\u201cMy name is Hareton Earnshaw,\u201d growled the other; \u201cand I\u2019d counsel you\nto respect it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown no disrespect,\u201d was my reply, laughing internally at the\ndignity with which he announced himself.\n\nHe fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for\nfear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity\naudible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant\nfamily circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than\nneutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to\nbe cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.\n\nThe business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\nsociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A\nsorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\nhills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,\u201d I\ncould not help exclaiming. \u201cThe roads will be buried already; and, if\nthey were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They\u2019ll be\ncovered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,\u201d\nsaid Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cHow must I do?\u201d I continued, with rising irritation.\n\nThere was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only\nJoseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff\nleaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of\nmatches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the\ntea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his\nburden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated\nout\u2014\u201cAw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i\u2019 idleness un war,\nwhen all on \u2019ems goan out! Bud yah\u2019re a nowt, and it\u2019s no use\ntalking\u2014yah\u2019ll niver mend o\u2019yer ill ways, but goa raight to t\u2019 divil,\nlike yer mother afore ye!\u201d\n\nI imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to\nme; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an\nintention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however,\nchecked me by her answer.\n\n\u201cYou scandalous old hypocrite!\u201d she replied. \u201cAre you not afraid of\nbeing carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil\u2019s name? I\nwarn you to refrain from provoking me, or I\u2019ll ask your abduction as a\nspecial favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,\u201d she continued, taking a long,\ndark book from a shelf; \u201cI\u2019ll show you how far I\u2019ve progressed in the\nBlack Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The\nred cow didn\u2019t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be\nreckoned among providential visitations!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, wicked, wicked!\u201d gasped the elder; \u201cmay the Lord deliver us from\nevil!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, reprobate! you are a castaway\u2014be off, or I\u2019ll hurt you seriously!\nI\u2019ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes\nthe limits I fix shall\u2014I\u2019ll not say what he shall be done to\u2014but,\nyou\u2019ll see! Go, I\u2019m looking at you!\u201d\n\nThe little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and\nJoseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and\nejaculating \u201cwicked\u201d as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted\nby a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured\nto interest her in my distress.\n\n\u201cMrs. Heathcliff,\u201d I said earnestly, \u201cyou must excuse me for troubling\nyou. I presume, because, with that face, I\u2019m sure you cannot help being\ngood-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way\nhome: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to\nget to London!\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the road you came,\u201d she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,\nwith a candle, and the long book open before her. \u201cIt is brief advice,\nbut as sound as I can give.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full\nof snow, your conscience won\u2019t whisper that it is partly your fault?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn\u2019t let me go to the end of the\ngarden wall.\u201d\n\n\u201c_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my\nconvenience, on such a night,\u201d I cried. \u201cI want you to _tell_ me my\nway, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a\nguide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you\nhave?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there no boys at the farm?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; those are all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, it follows that I am compelled to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on\nthese hills,\u201d cried Heathcliff\u2019s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.\n\u201cAs to staying here, I don\u2019t keep accommodations for visitors: you must\nshare a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can sleep on a chair in this room,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cNo, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit\nme to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!\u201d said\nthe unmannerly wretch.\n\nWith this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of\ndisgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in\nmy haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and,\nas I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour\namongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend\nme.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with him as far as the park,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll go with him to hell!\u201d exclaimed his master, or whatever\nrelation he bore. \u201cAnd who is to look after the horses, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cA man\u2019s life is of more consequence than one evening\u2019s neglect of the\nhorses: somebody must go,\u201d murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I\nexpected.\n\n\u201cNot at your command!\u201d retorted Hareton. \u201cIf you set store on him,\nyou\u2019d better be quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will\nnever get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,\u201d she answered,\nsharply.\n\n\u201cHearken, hearken, shoo\u2019s cursing on \u2019em!\u201d muttered Joseph, towards\nwhom I had been steering.\n\nHe sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern,\nwhich I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it\nback on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.\n\n\u201cMaister, maister, he\u2019s staling t\u2019 lanthern!\u201d shouted the ancient,\npursuing my retreat. \u201cHey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him,\nholld him!\u201d\n\nOn opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat,\nbearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw\nfrom Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and\nhumiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching\ntheir paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me\nalive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie\ntill their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and\ntrembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out\u2014on their\nperil to keep me one minute longer\u2014with several incoherent threats of\nretaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of\nKing Lear.\n\nThe vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the\nnose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don\u2019t know\nwhat would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at\nhand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my\nentertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued\nforth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some\nof them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack\nher master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger\nscoundrel.\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Earnshaw,\u201d she cried, \u201cI wonder what you\u2019ll have agait next?\nAre we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house\nwill never do for me\u2014look at t\u2019 poor lad, he\u2019s fair choking! Wisht,\nwisht; you mun\u2019n\u2019t go on so. Come in, and I\u2019ll cure that: there now,\nhold ye still.\u201d\n\nWith these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my\nneck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his\naccidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.\n\nI was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled\nperforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a\nglass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she\ncondoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders,\nwhereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhile leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the\ncandle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about\nthe chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there\nwillingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had\nonly lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on,\nshe could not begin to be curious.\n\nToo stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced\nround for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a\nclothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top\nresembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked\ninside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,\nvery conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of\nthe family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little\ncloset, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a\ntable.\n\nI slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them\ntogether again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff,\nand every one else.\n\nThe ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up\nin one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.\nThis writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of\ncharacters, large and small\u2014_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied\nto _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.\n\nIn vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued\nspelling over Catherine Earnshaw\u2014Heathcliff\u2014Linton, till my eyes\nclosed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white\nletters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres\u2014the air swarmed\nwith Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I\ndiscovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and\nperfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.\n\nI snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and\nlingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.\nIt was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a\nfly-leaf bore the inscription\u2014\u201cCatherine Earnshaw, her book,\u201d and a\ndate some quarter of a century back.\n\nI shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.\nCatherine\u2019s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it\nto have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose:\nscarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary\u2014at least the\nappearance of one\u2014covering every morsel of blank that the printer had\nleft. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a\nregular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an\nextra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was\ngreatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend\nJoseph,\u2014rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled\nwithin me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher\nher faded hieroglyphics.\n\n\u201cAn awful Sunday,\u201d commenced the paragraph beneath. \u201cI wish my father\nwere back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute\u2014his conduct to\nHeathcliff is atrocious\u2014H. and I are going to rebel\u2014we took our\ninitiatory step this evening.\n\n\u201cAll day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so\nJoseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while\nHindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire\u2014doing\nanything but reading their Bibles, I\u2019ll answer for it\u2014Heathcliff,\nmyself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our\nprayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn,\ngroaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so\nthat he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The\nservice lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face\nto exclaim, when he saw us descending, \u2018What, done already?\u2019 On Sunday\nevenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much\nnoise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.\n\n\u201c\u2018You forget you have a master here,\u2019 says the tyrant. \u2018I\u2019ll demolish\nthe first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and\nsilence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you\ngo by: I heard him snap his fingers.\u2019 Frances pulled his hair heartily,\nand then went and seated herself on her husband\u2019s knee, and there they\nwere, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour\u2014foolish\npalaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our\nmeans allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our\npinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes\nJoseph, on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork,\nboxes my ears, and croaks:\n\n\u201c\u2018T\u2019 maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o\u2019ered, und t\u2019 sound\no\u2019 t\u2019 gospel still i\u2019 yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye!\nsit ye down, ill childer! there\u2019s good books eneugh if ye\u2019ll read \u2019em:\nsit ye down, and think o\u2019 yer sowls!\u2019\n\n\u201cSaying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might\nreceive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the\nlumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my\ndingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I\nhated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there\nwas a hubbub!\n\n\u201c\u2018Maister Hindley!\u2019 shouted our chaplain. \u2018Maister, coom hither! Miss\nCathy\u2019s riven th\u2019 back off \u201cTh\u2019 Helmet o\u2019 Salvation,\u201d un\u2019 Heathcliff\u2019s\npawsed his fit into t\u2019 first part o\u2019 \u201cT\u2019 Brooad Way to Destruction!\u201d\nIt\u2019s fair flaysome that ye let \u2019em go on this gait. Ech! th\u2019 owd man\nwad ha\u2019 laced \u2019em properly\u2014but he\u2019s goan!\u2019\n\n\u201cHindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of\nus by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the\nback-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, \u2018owd Nick\u2019 would fetch us as\nsure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate\nnook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a\nshelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got\nthe time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is\nimpatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman\u2019s\ncloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant\nsuggestion\u2014and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his\nprophecy verified\u2014we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we\nare here.\u201d\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\nI suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took\nup another subject: she waxed lachrymose.\n\n\u201cHow little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!\u201d she\nwrote. \u201cMy head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I\ncan\u2019t give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and\nwon\u2019t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he\nand I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the\nhouse if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father (how dared\nhe?) for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to\nhis right place\u2014\u201d\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\nI began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from\nmanuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title\u2014\u201cSeventy Times Seven,\nand the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the\nReverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.\u201d And while\nI was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez\nBranderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell\nasleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else\ncould it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don\u2019t remember\nanother that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of\nsuffering.\n\nI began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.\nI thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph\nfor a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered\non, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not\nbrought a pilgrim\u2019s staff: telling me that I could never get into the\nhouse without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel,\nwhich I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it\nabsurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own\nresidence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we\nwere journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the\ntext\u2014\u201cSeventy Times Seven;\u201d and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had\ncommitted the \u201cFirst of the Seventy-First,\u201d and were to be publicly\nexposed and excommunicated.\n\nWe came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or\nthrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow,\nnear a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes\nof embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept\nwhole hitherto; but as the clergyman\u2019s stipend is only twenty pounds\nper annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to\ndetermine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:\nespecially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let\nhim starve than increase the living by one penny from their own\npockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive\ncongregation; and he preached\u2014good God! what a sermon; divided into\n_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary\naddress from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he\nsearched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of\ninterpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin\ndifferent sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious\ncharacter: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.\n\nOh, how weary I grew. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and\nrevived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and\nstood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he\nwould _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he\nreached the \u201c_First of the Seventy-First_.\u201d At that crisis, a sudden\ninspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez\nBranderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201csitting here within these four walls, at one\nstretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads\nof your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat\nand been about to depart\u2014Seventy times seven times have you\npreposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and\nninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down,\nand crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no\nmore!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Thou art the Man!_\u201d cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over\nhis cushion. \u201cSeventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy\nvisage\u2014seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul\u2014Lo, this is\nhuman weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the\nSeventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.\nSuch honour have all His saints!\u201d\n\nWith that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim\u2019s\nstaves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in\nself-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most\nferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude,\nseveral clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.\nPresently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter\nrappings: every man\u2019s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,\nunwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud\ntaps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at\nlast, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had\nsuggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez\u2019s part in the\nrow? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the\nblast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I\nlistened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and\ndozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than\nbefore.\n\nThis time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard\ndistinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,\nthe fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right\ncause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if\npossible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the\ncasement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance\nobserved by me when awake, but forgotten. \u201cI must stop it,\nnevertheless!\u201d I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and\nstretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of\nwhich, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!\n\nThe intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my\narm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,\n\n\u201cLet me in\u2014let me in!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.\n\n\u201cCatherine Linton,\u201d it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of\n_Linton_? I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)\u2014\u201cI\u2019m come\nhome: I\u2019d lost my way on the moor!\u201d\n\nAs it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child\u2019s face looking through the\nwindow. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt\nshaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and\nrubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:\nstill it wailed, \u201cLet me in!\u201d and maintained its tenacious gripe,\nalmost maddening me with fear.\n\n\u201cHow can I!\u201d I said at length. \u201cLet _me_ go, if you want me to let you\nin!\u201d\n\nThe fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled\nthe books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude\nthe lamentable prayer.\n\nI seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the\ninstant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!\n\n\u201cBegone!\u201d I shouted. \u201cI\u2019ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty\nyears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is twenty years,\u201d mourned the voice: \u201ctwenty years. I\u2019ve been a\nwaif for twenty years!\u201d\n\nThereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved\nas if thrust forward.\n\nI tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in\na frenzy of fright.\n\nTo my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps\napproached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous\nhand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.\nI sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:\nthe intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.\n\nAt last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,\n\n\u201cIs any one here?\u201d\n\nI considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff\u2019s\naccents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.\n\nWith this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon\nforget the effect my action produced.\n\nHeathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a\ncandle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall\nbehind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric\nshock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and\nhis agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.\n\n\u201cIt is only your guest, sir,\u201d I called out, desirous to spare him the\nhumiliation of exposing his cowardice further. \u201cI had the misfortune to\nscream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I\u2019m sorry I\ndisturbed you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the\u2014\u201d commenced\nmy host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible\nto hold it steady. \u201cAnd who showed you up into this room?\u201d he\ncontinued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to\nsubdue the maxillary convulsions. \u201cWho was it? I\u2019ve a good mind to turn\nthem out of the house this moment!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was your servant Zillah,\u201d I replied, flinging myself on to the\nfloor, and rapidly resuming my garments. \u201cI should not care if you did,\nMr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to\nget another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it\nis\u2014swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,\nI assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Heathcliff, \u201cand what are you doing? Lie down\nand finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven\u2019s sake!\ndon\u2019t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you\nwere having your throat cut!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have\nstrangled me!\u201d I returned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to endure the persecutions of\nyour hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham\nakin to you on the mother\u2019s side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or\nEarnshaw, or however she was called\u2014she must have been a\nchangeling\u2014wicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the\nearth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal\ntransgressions, I\u2019ve no doubt!\u201d\n\nScarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of\nHeathcliff\u2019s with Catherine\u2019s name in the book, which had completely\nslipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my\ninconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the\noffence, I hastened to add\u2014\u201cThe truth is, sir, I passed the first part\nof the night in\u2014\u201d Here I stopped afresh\u2014I was about to say \u201cperusing\nthose old volumes,\u201d then it would have revealed my knowledge of their\nwritten, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I\nwent on\u2014\u201cin spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A\nmonotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_\u201d thundered\nHeathcliff with savage vehemence. \u201cHow\u2014how _dare_ you, under my\nroof?\u2014God! he\u2019s mad to speak so!\u201d And he struck his forehead with rage.\n\nI did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my\nexplanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and\nproceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation\nof \u201cCatherine Linton\u201d before, but reading it often over produced an\nimpression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination\nunder control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the\nbed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I\nguessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he\nstruggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show\nhim that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather\nnoisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the\nnight: \u201cNot three o\u2019clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six.\nTime stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways at nine in winter, and rise at four,\u201d said my host, suppressing\na groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm\u2019s shadow, dashing\na tear from his eyes. \u201cMr. Lockwood,\u201d he added, \u201cyou may go into my\nroom: you\u2019ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your\nchildish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for me, too,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ll walk in the yard till daylight, and\nthen I\u2019ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.\nI\u2019m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or\ntown. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelightful company!\u201d muttered Heathcliff. \u201cTake the candle, and go\nwhere you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,\nthough, the dogs are unchained; and the house\u2014Juno mounts sentinel\nthere, and\u2014nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,\naway with you! I\u2019ll come in two minutes!\u201d\n\nI obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the\nnarrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a\npiece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,\nhis apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the\nlattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion\nof tears. \u201cCome in! come in!\u201d he sobbed. \u201cCathy, do come. Oh, do\u2014_once_\nmore! Oh! my heart\u2019s darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!\u201d\nThe spectre showed a spectre\u2019s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of\nbeing; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my\nstation, and blowing out the light.\n\nThere was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this\nraving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,\nhalf angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my\nridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was\nbeyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions,\nand landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly\ntogether, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except\na brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a\nquerulous mew.\n\nTwo benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the\nhearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the\nother. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and\nthen it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the\nroof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a\nsinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between\nthe ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in\nthe vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with\ntobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of\nimpudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his\nlips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury\nunannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a\nprofound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.\n\nA more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a\n\u201cgood-morning,\u201d but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for\nHareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of\ncurses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a\ncorner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over\nthe back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of\nexchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,\nby his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard\ncouch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an\ninner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate\nsound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my\nlocality.\n\nIt opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah\nurging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.\nHeathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the\nblaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her\neyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to\nchide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,\nnow and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was\nsurprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back\ntowards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever\nand anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron,\nand heave an indignant groan.\n\n\u201cAnd you, you worthless\u2014\u201d he broke out as I entered, turning to his\ndaughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or\nsheep, but generally represented by a dash\u2014. \u201cThere you are, at your\nidle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread\u2014you live on my\ncharity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay\nme for the plague of having you eternally in my sight\u2014do you hear,\ndamnable jade?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,\u201d answered\nthe young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair. \u201cBut I\u2019ll\nnot do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I\nplease!\u201d\n\nHeathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,\nobviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be\nentertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if\neager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any\nknowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to\nsuspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of\ntemptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked\nto a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a\nstatue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined\njoining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an\nopportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and\ncold as impalpable ice.\n\nMy landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the\ngarden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he\ndid, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells\nand falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the\nground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges\nof mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my\nyesterday\u2019s walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side\nof the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright\nstones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were\nerected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark,\nand also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on\neither hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing\nup here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my\ncompanion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the\nright or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings\nof the road.\n\nWe exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of\nThrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were\nlimited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own\nresources; for the porter\u2019s lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance\nfrom the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make\nit four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the\nneck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it\ncan appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock\nchimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for\nevery mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.\n\nMy human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,\ntumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured\nthat I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set\nabout the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw\nme returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs;\nwhence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or\nforty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study,\nfeeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and\nsmoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWhat vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself\nindependent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at\nlength, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable\u2014I,\nweak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits\nand solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under\npretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my\nestablishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit\ndown while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,\nand either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.\n\n\u201cYou have lived here a considerable time,\u201d I commenced; \u201cdid you not\nsay sixteen years?\u201d\n\n\u201cEighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;\nafter she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\nThere ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her\nown affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having\nstudied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of\nmeditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated\u2014\u201cAh, times are\ngreatly changed since then!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I remarked, \u201cyou\u2019ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have: and troubles too,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll turn the talk on my landlord\u2019s family!\u201d I thought to myself.\n\u201cA good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to\nknow her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is\nmore probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise\nfor kin.\u201d With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let\nThrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence\nso much inferior. \u201cIs he not rich enough to keep the estate in good\norder?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cRich, sir!\u201d she returned. \u201cHe has nobody knows what money, and every\nyear it increases. Yes, yes, he\u2019s rich enough to live in a finer house\nthan this: but he\u2019s very near\u2014close-handed; and, if he had meant to\nflit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he\ncould not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.\nIt is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the\nworld!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a son, it seems?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he had one\u2014he is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did she come from originally?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, sir, she is my late master\u2019s daughter: Catherine Linton was her\nmaiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would\nremove here, and then we might have been together again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! Catherine Linton?\u201d I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute\u2019s\nreflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. \u201cThen,\u201d I\ncontinued, \u201cmy predecessor\u2019s name was Linton?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.\nHeathcliff? Are they relations?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; he is the late Mrs. Linton\u2019s nephew.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe young lady\u2019s cousin, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother\u2019s, the\nother on the father\u2019s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton\u2019s sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see the house at Wuthering Heights has \u2018Earnshaw\u2019 carved over the\nfront door. Are they an old family?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is\nof us\u2014I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg\npardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I\nthink, not very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear, I don\u2019t wonder! And how did you like the master?\u201d\n\n\u201cA rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?\u201d\n\n\u201cRough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with\nhim the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.\nDo you know anything of his history?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cuckoo\u2019s, sir\u2014I know all about it: except where he was born,\nand who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And\nHareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate\nlad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has\nbeen cheated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of\nmy neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good\nenough to sit and chat an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, certainly, sir! I\u2019ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I\u2019ll sit\nas long as you please. But you\u2019ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and\nyou must have some gruel to drive it out.\u201d\n\nThe worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head\nfelt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to\na pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to\nfeel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious\neffects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned\npresently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having\nplaced the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to\nfind me so companionable.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nBefore I came to live here, she commenced\u2014waiting no farther invitation\nto her story\u2014I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my\nmother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton\u2019s father, and\nI got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped\nto make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody\nwould set me to. One fine summer morning\u2014it was the beginning of\nharvest, I remember\u2014Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs,\ndressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be\ndone during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me\u2014for I sat\neating my porridge with them\u2014and he said, speaking to his son, \u201cNow, my\nbonny man, I\u2019m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You\nmay choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there\nand back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!\u201d Hindley named a\nfiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but\nshe could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did\nnot forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe\nsometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and\nthen he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.\n\nIt seemed a long while to us all\u2014the three days of his absence\u2014and\noften did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw\nexpected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal\noff hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at\nlast the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then\nit grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to\nbe allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o\u2019clock, the door-latch\nwas raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a\nchair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was\nnearly killed\u2014he would not have such another walk for the three\nkingdoms.\n\n\u201cAnd at the end of it to be flighted to death!\u201d he said, opening his\ngreat-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. \u201cSee here, wife! I\nwas never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e\u2019en take it\nas a gift of God; though it\u2019s as dark almost as if it came from the\ndevil.\u201d\n\nWe crowded round, and over Miss Cathy\u2019s head I had a peep at a dirty,\nragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed,\nits face looked older than Catherine\u2019s; yet when it was set on its\nfeet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some\ngibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs.\nEarnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how\nhe could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had\ntheir own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and\nwhether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was\nreally half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst\nher scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and\nas good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and\ninquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;\nand his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take\nit home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he\nwas determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the\nconclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr.\nEarnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep\nwith the children.\n\nHindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till\npeace was restored: then, both began searching their father\u2019s pockets\nfor the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of\nfourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to\nmorsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she\nlearned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger,\nshowed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing;\nearning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her\ncleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or\neven in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing\nof the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or\nelse attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw\u2019s door,\nand there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as\nto how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my\ncowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.\n\nThis was Heathcliff\u2019s first introduction to the family. On coming back\na few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual),\nI found they had christened him \u201cHeathcliff\u201d: it was the name of a son\nwho died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for\nChristian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but\nHindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued\nand went on with him shamefully: for I wasn\u2019t reasonable enough to feel\nmy injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when\nshe saw him wronged.\n\nHe seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:\nhe would stand Hindley\u2019s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and\nmy pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if\nhe had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This\nendurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son\npersecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to\nHeathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said\nprecious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above\nCathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.\n\nSo, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at\nMrs. Earnshaw\u2019s death, which happened in less than two years after, the\nyoung master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather\nthan a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent\u2019s affections\nand his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these\ninjuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the\nmeasles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at\nonce, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he\nlay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose\nhe felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn\u2019t wit to guess that I\nwas compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest\nchild that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the\nothers forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me\nterribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not\ngentleness, made him give little trouble.\n\nHe got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing\nto me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and\nsoftened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus\nHindley lost his last ally: still I couldn\u2019t dote on Heathcliff, and I\nwondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;\nwho never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of\ngratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply\ninsensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and\nconscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to\nbend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought\na couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.\nHeathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he\ndiscovered it, he said to Hindley\u2014\n\n\u201cYou must exchange horses with me: I don\u2019t like mine; and if you won\u2019t\nI shall tell your father of the three thrashings you\u2019ve given me this\nweek, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.\u201d Hindley put\nout his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. \u201cYou\u2019d better do it at\nonce,\u201d he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):\n\u201cyou will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you\u2019ll get them again\nwith interest.\u201d \u201cOff, dog!\u201d cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron\nweight used for weighing potatoes and hay. \u201cThrow it,\u201d he replied,\nstanding still, \u201cand then I\u2019ll tell how you boasted that you would turn\nme out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn\nyou out directly.\u201d Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and\ndown he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,\nhad not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and\ngot full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who\nhad caused it. \u201cTake my colt, Gipsy, then!\u201d said young Earnshaw. \u201cAnd I\npray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly\ninterloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards\nshow him what you are, imp of Satan.\u2014And take that, I hope he\u2019ll kick\nout your brains!\u201d\n\nHeathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall;\nhe was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking\nhim under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes\nwere fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to\nwitness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his\nintention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a\nbundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,\nbefore he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the\nblame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told\nsince he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such\nstirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was\ndeceived completely, as you will hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active\nand healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was\nconfined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing\nvexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into\nfits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose\nupon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a\nword should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head\nthe notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to\ndo him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder\namong us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his\npartiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child\u2019s\npride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,\nor thrice, Hindley\u2019s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,\nroused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and\nshook with rage that he could not do it.\n\nAt last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by\nteaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land\nhimself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.\nEarnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said\u2014\u201cHindley was\nnought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.\u201d\n\nI hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the\nmaster should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the\ndiscontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as\nhe would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his\nsinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for\ntwo people\u2014Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,\nup yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest\nself-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the\npromises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his\nknack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a\ngreat impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master\nbecame, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him\nabout his soul\u2019s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He\nencouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after\nnight, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against\nHeathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw\u2019s weakness\nby heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.\n\nCertainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up\nbefore; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener\nin a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to\nbed, we had not a minute\u2019s security that she wouldn\u2019t be in mischief.\nHer spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always\ngoing\u2014singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the\nsame. A wild, wicked slip she was\u2014but she had the bonniest eye, the\nsweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I\nbelieve she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good\nearnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and\noblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too\nfond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was\nto keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us\non his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little\nmistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she\ndid so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let\nher know.\n\nNow, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had\nalways been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had\nno idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing\ncondition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her\na naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we\nwere all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy\nlook, and her ready words; turning Joseph\u2019s religious curses into\nridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most\u2014showing\nhow her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over\nHeathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in\nanything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After\nbehaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to\nmake it up at night. \u201cNay, Cathy,\u201d the old man would say, \u201cI cannot\nlove thee, thou\u2019rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child,\nand ask God\u2019s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever\nreared thee!\u201d That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed\ncontinually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was\nsorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.\n\nBut the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw\u2019s troubles on\nearth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the\nfire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the\nchimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were\nall together\u2014I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,\nand Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally\nsat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been\nsick, and that made her still; she leant against her father\u2019s knee, and\nHeathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember\nthe master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair\u2014it\npleased him rarely to see her gentle\u2014and saying, \u201cWhy canst thou not\nalways be a good lass, Cathy?\u201d And she turned her face up to his, and\nlaughed, and answered, \u201cWhy cannot you always be a good man, father?\u201d\nBut as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said\nshe would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his\nfingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told\nher to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as\nmute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only\nJoseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse\nthe master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by\nname, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the\ncandle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set\ndown the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them\nto \u201cframe upstairs, and make little din\u2014they might pray alone that\nevening\u2014he had summut to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall bid father good-night first,\u201d said Catherine, putting her arms\nround his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered\nher loss directly\u2014she screamed out\u2014\u201cOh, he\u2019s dead, Heathcliff! he\u2019s\ndead!\u201d And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.\n\nI joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we\ncould be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He\ntold me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the\nparson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.\nHowever, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,\nback with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving\nJoseph to explain matters, I ran to the children\u2019s room: their door was\najar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but\nthey were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls\nwere comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit\non: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they\ndid, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could\nnot help wishing we were all there safe together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nMr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and\u2014a thing that amazed us, and\nset the neighbours gossiping right and left\u2014he brought a wife with him.\nWhat she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,\nshe had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely\nhave kept the union from his father.\n\nShe was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own\naccount. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,\nappeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about\nher: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the\nmourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that\nwent on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I\nshould have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and\nclasping her hands, and asking repeatedly\u2014\u201cAre they gone yet?\u201d Then she\nbegan describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her\nto see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell\na-weeping\u2014and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn\u2019t\nknow; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely\nto die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and\nfresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did\nremark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very\nquick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that\nshe coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these\nsymptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don\u2019t\nin general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to\nus first.\n\nYoung Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his\nabsence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and\ndressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told\nJoseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the\nback-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have\ncarpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife\nexpressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,\nat the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space\nthere was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it\nunnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.\n\nShe expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new\nacquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran\nabout with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.\nHer affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,\nHindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to\nHeathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.\nHe drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the\ninstructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of\ndoors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the\nfarm.\n\nHeathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy\ntaught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the\nfields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the\nyoung master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they\ndid, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their\ngoing to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his\ncarelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to\norder Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or\nsupper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the\nmoors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment\ngrew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as\nhe pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash\nHeathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they\nwere together again: at least the minute they had contrived some\nnaughty plan of revenge; and many a time I\u2019ve cried to myself to watch\nthem growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,\nfor fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended\ncreatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from\nthe sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;\nand when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.\nWe searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they\nwere invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the\ndoors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household\nwent to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put\nmy head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in\nspite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I\ndistinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern\nglimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to\nprevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was\nHeathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.\n\n\u201cWhere is Miss Catherine?\u201d I cried hurriedly. \u201cNo accident, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cAt Thrushcross Grange,\u201d he answered; \u201cand I would have been there too,\nbut they had not the manners to ask me to stay.\u201d \u201cWell, you will catch\nit!\u201d I said: \u201cyou\u2019ll never be content till you\u2019re sent about your\nbusiness. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?\u201d\n\u201cLet me get off my wet clothes, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it, Nelly,\u201d\nhe replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he\nundressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued\u2014\u201cCathy and I\nescaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a\nglimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see\nwhether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in\ncorners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and\nsinging and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do\nyou think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their\nman-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they\ndon\u2019t answer properly?\u201d \u201cProbably not,\u201d I responded. \u201cThey are good\nchildren, no doubt, and don\u2019t deserve the treatment you receive, for\nyour bad conduct.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t cant, Nelly,\u201d he said: \u201cnonsense! We ran from\nthe top of the Heights to the park, without stopping\u2014Catherine\ncompletely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You\u2019ll have to\nseek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken\nhedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a\nflower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence;\nthey had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half\nclosed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,\nand clinging to the ledge, and we saw\u2014ah! it was beautiful\u2014a splendid\nplace carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and\na pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging\nin silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft\ntapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister\nhad it entirely to themselves. Shouldn\u2019t they have been happy? We\nshould have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good\nchildren were doing? Isabella\u2014I believe she is eleven, a year younger\nthan Cathy\u2014lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as\nif witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the\nhearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little\ndog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,\nwe understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots!\nThat was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm\nhair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,\nrefused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did\ndespise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine\nwanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and\nsobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I\u2019d not\nexchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton\u2019s\nat Thrushcross Grange\u2014not if I might have the privilege of flinging\nJoseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with\nHindley\u2019s blood!\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, hush!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cStill you have not told me, Heathcliff,\nhow Catherine is left behind?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you we laughed,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe Lintons heard us, and with\none accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and\nthen a cry, \u2018Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh,\npapa, oh!\u2019 They really did howl out something in that way. We made\nfrightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off\nthe ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had\nbetter flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all\nat once she fell down. \u2018Run, Heathcliff, run!\u2019 she whispered. \u2018They\nhave let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!\u2019 The devil had seized her\nankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out\u2014no!\nshe would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns\nof a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate\nany fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his\njaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast\nof a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting\u2014\u2018Keep fast,\nSkulker, keep fast!\u2019 He changed his note, however, when he saw\nSkulker\u2019s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue\nhanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming\nwith bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,\nI\u2019m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling\nexecrations and vengeance. \u2018What prey, Robert?\u2019 hallooed Linton from\nthe entrance. \u2018Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,\u2019 he replied; \u2018and\nthere\u2019s a lad here,\u2019 he added, making a clutch at me, \u2018who looks an\nout-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the\nwindow to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they\nmight murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed\nthief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,\ndon\u2019t lay by your gun.\u2019 \u2018No, no, Robert,\u2019 said the old fool. \u2018The\nrascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me\ncleverly. Come in; I\u2019ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten\nthe chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his\nstronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop?\nOh, my dear Mary, look here! Don\u2019t be afraid, it is but a boy\u2014yet the\nvillain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to\nthe country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as\nwell as features?\u2019 He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton\nplaced her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The\ncowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping\u2014\u2018Frightful thing!\nPut him in the cellar, papa. He\u2019s exactly like the son of the\nfortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn\u2019t he, Edgar?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,\nand laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected\nsufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know,\nthough we seldom meet them elsewhere. \u2018That\u2019s Miss Earnshaw!\u2019 he\nwhispered to his mother, \u2018and look how Skulker has bitten her\u2014how her\nfoot bleeds!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!\u2019 cried the dame; \u2018Miss Earnshaw scouring the\ncountry with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning\u2014surely\nit is\u2014and she may be lamed for life!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What culpable carelessness in her brother!\u2019 exclaimed Mr. Linton,\nturning from me to Catherine. \u2018I\u2019ve understood from Shielders\u2019\u201d (that\nwas the curate, sir) \u201c\u2018that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.\nBut who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare\nhe is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey\nto Liverpool\u2014a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018A wicked boy, at all events,\u2019 remarked the old lady, \u2018and quite unfit\nfor a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I\u2019m shocked\nthat my children should have heard it.\u2019\n\n\u201cI recommenced cursing\u2014don\u2019t be angry, Nelly\u2014and so Robert was ordered\nto take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the\ngarden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw\nshould be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,\nsecured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one\ncorner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had\nwished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a\nmillion of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa\nquietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we\nhad borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with\nher, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction\nbetween her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin\nof warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of\nnegus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar\nstood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her\nbeautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled\nher to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her\nfood between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he\nate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the\nLintons\u2014a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were\nfull of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them\u2014to\neverybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will more come of this business than you reckon on,\u201d I answered,\ncovering him up and extinguishing the light. \u201cYou are incurable,\nHeathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if\nhe won\u2019t.\u201d My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure\nmade Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a\nvisit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture\non the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about\nhim, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that\nthe first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;\nand Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint\nwhen she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would\nhave found it impossible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nCathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that\ntime her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The\nmistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of\nreform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and\nflattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless\nlittle savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all\nbreathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified\nperson, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered\nbeaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with\nboth hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,\nexclaiming delightedly, \u201cWhy, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should\nscarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is\nnot to be compared with her, is she, Frances?\u201d \u201cIsabella has not her\nnatural advantages,\u201d replied his wife: \u201cbut she must mind and not grow\nwild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things\u2014Stay,\ndear, you will disarrange your curls\u2014let me untie your hat.\u201d\n\nI removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk\nfrock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes\nsparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she\ndared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid\ngarments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas\ncake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked\nround for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their\nmeeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what\ngrounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.\n\nHeathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and\nuncared for, before Catherine\u2019s absence, he had been ten times more so\nsince. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,\nand bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom\nhave a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention\nhis clothes, which had seen three months\u2019 service in mire and dust, and\nhis thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally\nbeclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a\nbright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed\ncounterpart of himself, as he expected. \u201cIs Heathcliff not here?\u201d she\ndemanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully\nwhitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.\n\n\u201cHeathcliff, you may come forward,\u201d cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\ndiscomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard\nhe would be compelled to present himself. \u201cYou may come and wish Miss\nCatherine welcome, like the other servants.\u201d\n\nCathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to\nembrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the\nsecond, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,\nexclaiming, \u201cWhy, how very black and cross you look! and how\u2014how funny\nand grim! But that\u2019s because I\u2019m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.\nWell, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?\u201d\n\nShe had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw\ndouble gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.\n\n\u201cShake hands, Heathcliff,\u201d said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; \u201conce in\na way, that is permitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall not,\u201d replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; \u201cI shall\nnot stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!\u201d\n\nAnd he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him\nagain.\n\n\u201cI did not mean to laugh at you,\u201d she said; \u201cI could not hinder myself:\nHeathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only\nthat you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will\nbe all right: but you are so dirty!\u201d\n\nShe gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and\nalso at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from\nits contact with his.\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t have touched me!\u201d he answered, following her eye and\nsnatching away his hand. \u201cI shall be as dirty as I please: and I like\nto be dirty, and I will be dirty.\u201d\n\nWith that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of\nthe master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;\nwho could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an\nexhibition of bad temper.\n\nAfter playing lady\u2019s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the\noven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,\nbefitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by\nsinging carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph\u2019s affirmations that he\nconsidered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had\nretired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw\nwere engaging Missy\u2019s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to\npresent to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.\nThey had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the\ninvitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that\nher darlings might be kept carefully apart from that \u201cnaughty swearing\nboy.\u201d\n\nUnder these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent\nof the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the\npolished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready\nto be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless\npurity of my particular care\u2014the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave\ndue inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old\nEarnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,\nand slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I\nwent on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he\nshould suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally\nled me to consider the poor lad\u2019s situation now, and from singing I\nchanged my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be\nmore sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding\ntears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was\nnot far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the\nstable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.\n\n\u201cMake haste, Heathcliff!\u201d I said, \u201cthe kitchen is so comfortable; and\nJoseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss\nCathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth\nto yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.\u201d\n\nHe proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.\n\n\u201cCome\u2014are you coming?\u201d I continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a little cake for each of\nyou, nearly enough; and you\u2019ll need half-an-hour\u2019s donning.\u201d\n\nI waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped\nwith her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an\nunsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on\nthe other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the\nfairies. He managed to continue work till nine o\u2019clock, and then\nmarched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world\nof things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into\nthe kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only\nstayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the\nmorning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour\non to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for\nchurch. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better\nspirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his\ncourage, exclaimed abruptly\u2014\u201cNelly, make me decent, I\u2019m going to be\ngood.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh time, Heathcliff,\u201d I said; \u201cyou _have_ grieved Catherine: she\u2019s\nsorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her,\nbecause she is more thought of than you.\u201d\n\nThe notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the\nnotion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.\n\n\u201cDid she say she was grieved?\u201d he inquired, looking very serious.\n\n\u201cShe cried when I told her you were off again this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, _I_ cried last night,\u201d he returned, \u201cand I had more reason to\ncry than she.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an\nempty stomach,\u201d said I. \u201cProud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.\nBut, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,\nwhen she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say\u2014you\nknow best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought\nher converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I\nhave dinner to get ready, I\u2019ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar\nLinton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are\nyounger, and yet, I\u2019ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad\nacross the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don\u2019t\nyou feel that you could?\u201d\n\nHeathcliff\u2019s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and\nhe sighed.\n\n\u201cBut, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn\u2019t make him\nless handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,\nand was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich\nas he will be!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd cried for mamma at every turn,\u201d I added, \u201cand trembled if a\ncountry lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a\nshower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to\nthe glass, and I\u2019ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those\ntwo lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of\nrising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so\ndeeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting\nunder them, like devil\u2019s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly\nwrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to\nconfident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always\nseeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don\u2019t get the\nexpression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are\nits desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for\nwhat it suffers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton\u2019s great blue eyes and\neven forehead,\u201d he replied. \u201cI do\u2014and that won\u2019t help me to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,\u201d I continued, \u201cif\nyou were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into\nsomething worse than ugly. And now that we\u2019ve done washing, and\ncombing, and sulking\u2014tell me whether you don\u2019t think yourself rather\nhandsome? I\u2019ll tell you, I do. You\u2019re fit for a prince in disguise. Who\nknows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian\nqueen, each of them able to buy up, with one week\u2019s income, Wuthering\nHeights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by\nwicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would\nframe high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should\ngive me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little\nfarmer!\u201d\n\nSo I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to\nlook quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted\nby a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran\nto the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons\ndescend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the\nEarnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in\nwinter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them\ninto the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour\ninto their white faces.\n\nI urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he\nwillingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the\ndoor leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the\nother. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and\ncheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved\nhim back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph \u201ckeep the fellow\nout of the room\u2014send him into the garret till dinner is over. He\u2019ll be\ncramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone\nwith them a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, sir,\u201d I could not avoid answering, \u201che\u2019ll touch nothing, not he:\nand I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till\ndark,\u201d cried Hindley. \u201cBegone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting\nthe coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks\u2014see\nif I won\u2019t pull them a bit longer!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are long enough already,\u201d observed Master Linton, peeping from\nthe doorway; \u201cI wonder they don\u2019t make his head ache. It\u2019s like a\ncolt\u2019s mane over his eyes!\u201d\n\nHe ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but\nHeathcliff\u2019s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance\nof impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.\nHe seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under\nhis gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker\u2019s face and neck; who\ninstantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine\nhurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly\nand conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a\nrough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and\nbreathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed\nEdgar\u2019s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His\nsister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,\nblushing for all.\n\n\u201cYou should not have spoken to him!\u201d she expostulated with Master\nLinton. \u201cHe was in a bad temper, and now you\u2019ve spoilt your visit; and\nhe\u2019ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can\u2019t eat my dinner. Why\ndid you speak to him, Edgar?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the\nremainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. \u201cI\npromised mamma that I wouldn\u2019t say one word to him, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t cry,\u201d replied Catherine, contemptuously; \u201cyou\u2019re not\nkilled. Don\u2019t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,\nIsabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, children\u2014to your seats!\u201d cried Hindley, bustling in.\n\u201cThat brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar,\ntake the law into your own fists\u2014it will give you an appetite!\u201d\n\nThe little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant\nfeast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no\nreal harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,\nand the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her\nchair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an\nindifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.\n\u201cAn unfeeling child,\u201d I thought to myself; \u201chow lightly she dismisses\nher old playmate\u2019s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so\nselfish.\u201d She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down\nagain: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped\nher fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her\nemotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in\npurgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of\ngetting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been\nlocked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce\nto him a private mess of victuals.\n\nIn the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated\nthen, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and\nI was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in\nthe excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the\narrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a\ntrombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides\nsingers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive\ncontributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to\nhear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs\nand glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.\n\nCatherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of\nthe steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house\ndoor below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She\nmade no stay at the stairs\u2019-head, but mounted farther, to the garret\nwhere Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined\nanswering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to\nhold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things\nconverse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and\nthe singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to\nwarn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The\nlittle monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,\ninto the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I\ncould coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,\nand she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my\nfellow-servant had gone to a neighbour\u2019s, to be removed from the sound\nof our \u201cdevil\u2019s psalmody,\u201d as it pleased him to call it. I told them I\nintended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had\nnever broken his fast since yesterday\u2019s dinner, I would wink at his\ncheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the\nfire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and\ncould eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He\nleant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and\nremained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his\nthoughts, he answered gravely\u2014\u201cI\u2019m trying to settle how I shall pay\nHindley back. I don\u2019t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at\nlast. I hope he will not die before I do!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor shame, Heathcliff!\u201d said I. \u201cIt is for God to punish wicked\npeople; we should learn to forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, God won\u2019t have the satisfaction that I shall,\u201d he returned. \u201cI\nonly wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I\u2019ll plan it out:\nwhile I\u2019m thinking of that I don\u2019t feel pain.\u201d\n\nBut, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I\u2019m annoyed\nhow I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel\ncold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff\u2019s history,\nall that you need hear, in half a dozen words.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nThus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay\naside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I\nwas very far from nodding. \u201cSit still, Mrs. Dean,\u201d I cried; \u201cdo sit\nstill another half-hour. You\u2019ve done just right to tell the story\nleisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the\nsame style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more\nor less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter\u2014I\u2019m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or\ntwo is early enough for a person who lies till ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lie till ten. There\u2019s the very prime of the morning gone\nlong before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day\u2019s\nwork by ten o\u2019clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend\nlengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an\nobstinate cold, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three\nyears; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the\nmood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking\nits kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so\nintently that puss\u2019s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of\ntemper?\u201d\n\n\u201cA terribly lazy mood, I should say.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,\ntherefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions\nacquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does\nover a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the\ndeepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the\nlooker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less\nin surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love\nfor life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love\nof a year\u2019s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to\na single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do\nit justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French\ncooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but\neach part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,\u201d\nobserved Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I responded; \u201cyou, my good friend, are a striking evidence\nagainst that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight\nconsequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to\nconsider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great\ndeal more than the generality of servants think. You have been\ncompelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions\nfor frittering your life away in silly trifles.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dean laughed.\n\n\u201cI certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,\u201d she\nsaid; \u201cnot exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of\nfaces, and one series of actions, from year\u2019s end to year\u2019s end; but I\nhave undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then,\nI have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open\na book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something\nout of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of\nFrench; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can\nexpect of a poor man\u2019s daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in\ntrue gossip\u2019s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three\nyears, I will be content to pass to the next summer\u2014the summer of 1778,\nthat is nearly twenty-three years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nOn the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and\nthe last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the\nhay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our\nbreakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the\nlane, calling me as she ran.\n\n\u201cOh, such a grand bairn!\u201d she panted out. \u201cThe finest lad that ever\nbreathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she\u2019s been in a\nconsumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now\nshe has nothing to keep her, and she\u2019ll be dead before winter. You must\ncome home directly. You\u2019re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar\nand milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because\nit will be all yours when there is no missis!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is she very ill?\u201d I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my\nbonnet.\n\n\u201cI guess she is; yet she looks bravely,\u201d replied the girl, \u201cand she\ntalks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She\u2019s out of\nher head for joy, it\u2019s such a beauty! If I were her I\u2019m certain I\nshould not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite\nof Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub\ndown to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when\nthe old croaker steps forward, and says he\u2014\u2018Earnshaw, it\u2019s a blessing\nyour wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt\nconvinced we shouldn\u2019t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the\nwinter will probably finish her. Don\u2019t take on, and fret about it too\nmuch: it can\u2019t be helped. And besides, you should have known better\nthan to choose such a rush of a lass!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did the master answer?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cI think he swore: but I didn\u2019t mind him, I was straining to see the\nbairn,\u201d and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous\nas herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was\nvery sad for Hindley\u2019s sake. He had room in his heart only for two\nidols\u2014his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I\ncouldn\u2019t conceive how he would bear the loss.\n\nWhen we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;\nand, as I passed in, I asked, \u201chow was the baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly ready to run about, Nell!\u201d he replied, putting on a cheerful\nsmile.\n\n\u201cAnd the mistress?\u201d I ventured to inquire; \u201cthe doctor says she\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn the doctor!\u201d he interrupted, reddening. \u201cFrances is quite right:\nshe\u2019ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going\nupstairs? will you tell her that I\u2019ll come, if she\u2019ll promise not to\ntalk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she\nmust\u2014tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.\u201d\n\nI delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty\nspirits, and replied merrily, \u201cI hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there\nhe has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won\u2019t speak: but\nthat does not bind me not to laugh at him!\u201d\n\nPoor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed\nher; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming\nher health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his\nmedicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn\u2019t put\nhim to further expense by attending her, he retorted, \u201cI know you need\nnot\u2014she\u2019s well\u2014she does not want any more attendance from you! She\nnever was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse\nis as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.\u201d\n\nHe told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one\nnight, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought\nshe should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her\u2014a\nvery slight one\u2014he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about\nhis neck, her face changed, and she was dead.\n\nAs the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my\nhands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him\ncry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew\ndesperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither\nwept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave\nhimself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his\ntyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that\nwould stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you\nknow, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more\nreadily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants\nand labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had\nplenty of wickedness to reprove.\n\nThe master\u2019s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for\nCatherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to\nmake a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_\npossessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to\nwitness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily\nmore notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell\nwhat an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody\ndecent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton\u2019s visits to Miss\nCathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the\ncountry-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,\nheadstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;\nand I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she\nnever took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to\nold attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections\nunalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it\ndifficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master:\nthat is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side,\nand his wife\u2019s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you\nmight see something of what she was. Can you make that out?\n\nMrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,\nexceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive\nand amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light\nhair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;\nthe figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw\ncould forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much\nhow he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea\nof Catherine Earnshaw.\n\n\u201cA very agreeable portrait,\u201d I observed to the house-keeper. \u201cIs it\nlike?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered; \u201cbut he looked better when he was animated; that\nis his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.\u201d\n\nCatherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her\nfive-weeks\u2019 residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show\nher rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of\nbeing rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed\nunwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;\ngained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her\nbrother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first\u2014for she was\nfull of ambition\u2014and led her to adopt a double character without\nexactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard\nHeathcliff termed a \u201cvulgar young ruffian,\u201d and \u201cworse than a brute,\u201d\nshe took care not to act like him; but at home she had small\ninclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and\nrestrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor\npraise.\n\nMr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He\nhad a terror of Earnshaw\u2019s reputation, and shrunk from encountering\nhim; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:\nthe master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if\nhe could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his\nappearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,\nnever played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two\nfriends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of\nLinton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his\nabsence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,\nshe dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if\ndepreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.\nI\u2019ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which\nshe vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but\nshe was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,\ntill she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself,\nfinally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else\nthat she might fashion into an adviser.\n\nMr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed\nto give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age\nof sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being\ndeficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward\nand outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.\nIn the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early\neducation: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had\nextinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,\nand any love for books or learning. His childhood\u2019s sense of\nsuperiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was\nfaded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in\nher studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he\nyielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step\nin the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink\nbeneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with\nmental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;\nhis naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost\nidiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,\napparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few\nacquaintance.\n\nCatherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of\nrespite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her\nin words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,\nas if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks\nof affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the\nhouse to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting\nMiss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it\ninto his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place\nto herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her\nbrother\u2019s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.\n\n\u201cCathy, are you busy this afternoon?\u201d asked Heathcliff. \u201cAre you going\nanywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it is raining,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cWhy have you that silk frock on, then?\u201d he said. \u201cNobody coming here,\nI hope?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d stammered Miss: \u201cbut you should be in the field\nnow, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were\ngone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,\u201d observed\nthe boy. \u201cI\u2019ll not work any more to-day: I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but Joseph will tell,\u201d she suggested; \u201cyou\u2019d better go!\u201d\n\n\u201cJoseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will\ntake him till dark, and he\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected\nan instant, with knitted brows\u2014she found it needful to smooth the way\nfor an intrusion. \u201cIsabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this\nafternoon,\u201d she said, at the conclusion of a minute\u2019s silence. \u201cAs it\nrains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run\nthe risk of being scolded for no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrder Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,\u201d he persisted; \u201cdon\u2019t turn\nme out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I\u2019m on the point,\nsometimes, of complaining that they\u2014but I\u2019ll not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat they what?\u201d cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled\ncountenance. \u201cOh, Nelly!\u201d she added petulantly, jerking her head away\nfrom my hands, \u201cyou\u2019ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That\u2019s enough;\nlet me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,\nHeathcliff?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014only look at the almanack on that wall;\u201d he pointed to a\nframed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, \u201cThe crosses are\nfor the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those\nspent with me. Do you see? I\u2019ve marked every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014very foolish: as if I took notice!\u201d replied Catherine, in a\npeevish tone. \u201cAnd where is the sense of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo show that I _do_ take notice,\u201d said Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cAnd should I always be sitting with you?\u201d she demanded, growing more\nirritated. \u201cWhat good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be\ndumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you\ndo, either!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never told me before that I talked too little, or that you\ndisliked my company, Cathy!\u201d exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,\u201d she\nmuttered.\n\nHer companion rose up, but he hadn\u2019t time to express his feelings\nfurther, for a horse\u2019s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked\ngently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the\nunexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the\ndifference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.\nThe contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal\ncountry for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were\nas opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and\npronounced his words as you do: that\u2019s less gruff than we talk here,\nand softer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not come too soon, am I?\u201d he said, casting a look at me: I had\nbegun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the\ndresser.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered Catherine. \u201cWhat are you doing there, Nelly?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy work, Miss,\u201d I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to\nmake a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)\n\nShe stepped behind me and whispered crossly, \u201cTake yourself and your\ndusters off; when company are in the house, servants don\u2019t commence\nscouring and cleaning in the room where they are!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity, now that master is away,\u201d I answered aloud:\n\u201che hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I\u2019m\nsure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,\u201d exclaimed the young lady\nimperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to\nrecover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,\u201d was my response; and I proceeded\nassiduously with my occupation.\n\nShe, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my\nhand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the\narm. I\u2019ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her\nvanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up\nfrom my knees, and screamed out, \u201cOh, Miss, that\u2019s a nasty trick! You\nhave no right to nip me, and I\u2019m not going to bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t touch you, you lying creature!\u201d cried she, her fingers\ntingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had\npower to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a\nblaze.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, then?\u201d I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to\nrefute her.\n\nShe stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled\nby the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging\nblow that filled both eyes with water.\n\n\u201cCatherine, love! Catherine!\u201d interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the\ndouble fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.\n\n\u201cLeave the room, Ellen!\u201d she repeated, trembling all over.\n\nLittle Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on\nthe floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out\ncomplaints against \u201cwicked aunt Cathy,\u201d which drew her fury on to his\nunlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor\nchild waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to\ndeliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young\nman felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be\nmistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in\nmy arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of\ncommunication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle\ntheir disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had\nlaid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d I said to myself. \u201cTake warning and begone! It\u2019s a\nkindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.\n\nHe swerved aside, and attempted to pass.\n\n\u201cYou must not go!\u201d she exclaimed, energetically.\n\n\u201cI must and shall!\u201d he replied in a subdued voice.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she persisted, grasping the handle; \u201cnot yet, Edgar Linton: sit\ndown; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all\nnight, and I won\u2019t be miserable for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I stay after you have struck me?\u201d asked Linton.\n\nCatherine was mute.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,\u201d he continued; \u201cI\u2019ll not\ncome here again!\u201d\n\nHer eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.\n\n\u201cAnd you told a deliberate untruth!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d she cried, recovering her speech; \u201cI did nothing\ndeliberately. Well, go, if you please\u2014get away! And now I\u2019ll cry\u2014I\u2019ll\ncry myself sick!\u201d\n\nShe dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious\nearnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there\nhe lingered. I resolved to encourage him.\n\n\u201cMiss is dreadfully wayward, sir,\u201d I called out. \u201cAs bad as any marred\nchild: you\u2019d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to\ngrieve us.\u201d\n\nThe soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the\npower to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse\nhalf killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no\nsaving him: he\u2019s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he\nturned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind\nhim; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had\ncome home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears\n(his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had\nmerely effected a closer intimacy\u2014had broken the outworks of youthful\ntimidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and\nconfess themselves lovers.\n\nIntelligence of Mr. Hindley\u2019s arrival drove Linton speedily to his\nhorse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and\nto take the shot out of the master\u2019s fowling-piece, which he was fond\nof playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of\nany who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit\nupon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did\ngo the length of firing the gun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nHe entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the\nact of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was\nimpressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild\nbeast\u2019s fondness or his madman\u2019s rage; for in one he ran a chance of\nbeing squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung\ninto the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained\nperfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.\n\n\u201cThere, I\u2019ve found it out at last!\u201d cried Hindley, pulling me back by\nthe skin of my neck, like a dog. \u201cBy heaven and hell, you\u2019ve sworn\nbetween you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is\nalways out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you\nswallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn\u2019t laugh; for I\u2019ve just\ncrammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is\nthe same as one\u2014and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest\ntill I do!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,\u201d I answered; \u201cit has\nbeen cutting red herrings. I\u2019d rather be shot, if you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather be damned!\u201d he said; \u201cand so you shall. No law in England\ncan hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine\u2019s abominable!\nOpen your mouth.\u201d\n\nHe held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:\nbut, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out,\nand affirmed it tasted detestably\u2014I would not take it on any account.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said he, releasing me, \u201cI see that hideous little villain is not\nHareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive\nfor not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.\nUnnatural cub, come hither! I\u2019ll teach thee to impose on a\ngood-hearted, deluded father. Now, don\u2019t you think the lad would be\nhandsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something\nfierce\u2014get me a scissors\u2014something fierce and trim! Besides, it\u2019s\ninfernal affectation\u2014devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears\u2014we\u2019re\nasses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my\ndarling! wisht, dry thy eyes\u2014there\u2019s a joy; kiss me. What! it won\u2019t?\nKiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a\nmonster! As sure as I\u2019m living, I\u2019ll break the brat\u2019s neck.\u201d\n\nPoor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father\u2019s arms with all\nhis might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and\nlifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the\nchild into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley\nleant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost\nforgetting what he had in his hands. \u201cWho is that?\u201d he asked, hearing\nsome one approaching the stairs\u2019-foot. I leant forward also, for the\npurpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come\nfurther; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a\nsudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,\nand fell.\n\nThere was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw\nthat the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at\nthe critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and\nsetting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the\naccident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five\nshillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand\npounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding\nthe figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words\ncould do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument\nof thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have\ntried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton\u2019s skull on the steps;\nbut, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my\nprecious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely,\nsobered and abashed.\n\n\u201cIt is your fault, Ellen,\u201d he said; \u201cyou should have kept him out of\nsight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cInjured!\u201d I cried angrily; \u201cif he is not killed, he\u2019ll be an idiot!\nOh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use\nhim. You\u2019re worse than a heathen\u2014treating your own flesh and blood in\nthat manner!\u201d\n\nHe attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,\nsobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on\nhim, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if\nhe would go into convulsions.\n\n\u201cYou shall not meddle with him!\u201d I continued. \u201cHe hates you\u2014they all\nhate you\u2014that\u2019s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state\nyou\u2019re come to!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,\u201d laughed the misguided man,\nrecovering his hardness. \u201cAt present, convey yourself and him away. And\nhark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I\nwouldn\u2019t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:\nbut that\u2019s as my fancy goes.\u201d\n\nWhile saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and\npoured some into a tumbler.\n\n\u201cNay, don\u2019t!\u201d I entreated. \u201cMr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on\nthis unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cAny one will do better for him than I shall,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cHave mercy on your own soul!\u201d I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass\nfrom his hand.\n\n\u201cNot I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to\nperdition to punish its Maker,\u201d exclaimed the blasphemer. \u201cHere\u2019s to\nits hearty damnation!\u201d\n\nHe drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his\ncommand with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or\nremember.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,\u201d observed Heathcliff,\nmuttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. \u201cHe\u2019s doing\nhis very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he\nwould wager his mare that he\u2019ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,\nand go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the\ncommon course befall him.\u201d\n\nI went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.\nHeathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out\nafterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when\nhe flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and\nremained silent.\n\nI was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,\u2014\n\nIt was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,\nThe mither beneath the mools heard that,\n\n\nwhen Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her\nhead in, and whispered,\u2014\u201cAre you alone, Nelly?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Miss,\u201d I replied.\n\nShe entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to\nsay something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed\nand anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and\nshe drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I\nresumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Heathcliff?\u201d she said, interrupting me.\n\n\u201cAbout his work in the stable,\u201d was my answer.\n\nHe did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There\nfollowed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two\ntrickle from Catherine\u2019s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her\nshameful conduct?\u2014I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may\ncome to the point as she will\u2014I sha\u2019n\u2019t help her! No, she felt small\ntrouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.\n\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d she cried at last. \u201cI\u2019m very unhappy!\u201d\n\n\u201cA pity,\u201d observed I. \u201cYou\u2019re hard to please; so many friends and so\nfew cares, and can\u2019t make yourself content!\u201d\n\n\u201cNelly, will you keep a secret for me?\u201d she pursued, kneeling down by\nme, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look\nwhich turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the\nworld to indulge it.\n\n\u201cIs it worth keeping?\u201d I inquired, less sulkily.\n\n\u201cYes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I\nshould do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I\u2019ve\ngiven him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or\ndenial, you tell me which it ought to have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Miss Catherine, how can I know?\u201d I replied. \u201cTo be sure,\nconsidering the exhibition you performed in his presence this\nafternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked\nyou after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome\nfool.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you talk so, I won\u2019t tell you any more,\u201d she returned, peevishly\nrising to her feet. \u201cI accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I\nwas wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have\npledged your word, and cannot retract.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut say whether I should have done so\u2014do!\u201d she exclaimed in an\nirritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.\n\n\u201cThere are many things to be considered before that question can be\nanswered properly,\u201d I said, sententiously. \u201cFirst and foremost, do you\nlove Mr. Edgar?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho can help it? Of course I do,\u201d she answered.\n\nThen I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of\ntwenty-two it was not injudicious.\n\n\u201cWhy do you love him, Miss Cathy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, I do\u2014that\u2019s sufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means; you must say why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad!\u201d was my commentary.\n\n\u201cAnd because he is young and cheerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad, still.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd because he loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndifferent, coming there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the\nneighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorst of all. And now, say how you love him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs everybody loves\u2014You\u2019re silly, Nelly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all\u2014Answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and\neverything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks,\nand all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It\u2019s\nno jest to me!\u201d said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to\nthe fire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou love Mr.\nEdgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and\nloves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him\nwithout that, probably; and with it you wouldn\u2019t, unless he possessed\nthe four former attractions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, to be sure not: I should only pity him\u2014hate him, perhaps, if he\nwere ugly, and a clown.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:\nhandsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from\nloving them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there be any, they are out of my way: I\u2019ve seen none like Edgar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may see some; and he won\u2019t always be handsome, and young, and may\nnot always be rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would\nspeak rationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry\nMr. Linton.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your permission for that\u2014I _shall_ marry him: and yet you\nhave not told me whether I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And\nnow, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be\npleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will\nescape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable\none; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and\neasy: where is the obstacle?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Here_! and _here_!\u201d replied Catherine, striking one hand on her\nforehead, and the other on her breast: \u201cin whichever place the soul\nlives. In my soul and in my heart, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very strange! I cannot make it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I\u2019ll explain it: I\ncan\u2019t do it distinctly; but I\u2019ll give you a feeling of how I feel.\u201d\n\nShe seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,\nand her clasped hands trembled.\n\n\u201cNelly, do you never dream queer dreams?\u201d she said, suddenly, after\nsome minutes\u2019 reflection.\n\n\u201cYes, now and then,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cAnd so do I. I\u2019ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\never after, and changed my ideas: they\u2019ve gone through and through me,\nlike wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is\none: I\u2019m going to tell it\u2014but take care not to smile at any part of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! don\u2019t, Miss Catherine!\u201d I cried. \u201cWe\u2019re dismal enough without\nconjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and\nlike yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he\u2019s_ dreaming nothing dreary.\nHow sweetly he smiles in his sleep!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember\nhim, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:\nnearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to\nlisten: it\u2019s not long; and I\u2019ve no power to be merry to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t hear it, I won\u2019t hear it!\u201d I repeated, hastily.\n\nI was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had\nan unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which\nI might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was\nvexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,\nshe recommenced in a short time.\n\n\u201cIf I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are not fit to go there,\u201d I answered. \u201cAll sinners would\nbe miserable in heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you I won\u2019t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I\u2019ll go to\nbed,\u201d I interrupted again.\n\nShe laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d cried she: \u201cI was only going to say that heaven did\nnot seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back\nto earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\nmiddle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke\nsobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the\nother. I\u2019ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in\nheaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so\nlow, I shouldn\u2019t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry\nHeathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not\nbecause he\u2019s handsome, Nelly, but because he\u2019s more myself than I am.\nWhatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton\u2019s\nis as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.\u201d\n\nEre this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff\u2019s presence.\nHaving noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise\nfrom the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he\nheard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he\nstayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was\nprevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or\ndeparture; but I started, and bade her hush!\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, gazing nervously round.\n\n\u201cJoseph is here,\u201d I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\ncartwheels up the road; \u201cand Heathcliff will come in with him. I\u2019m not\nsure whether he were not at the door this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he couldn\u2019t overhear me at the door!\u201d said she. \u201cGive me Hareton,\nwhile you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.\nI want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that\nHeathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does\nnot know what being in love is!\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,\u201d I returned;\n\u201cand if _you_ are his choice, he\u2019ll be the most unfortunate creature\nthat ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,\nand love, and all! Have you considered how you\u2019ll bear the separation,\nand how he\u2019ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss\nCatherine\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe quite deserted! we separated!\u201d she exclaimed, with an accent of\nindignation. \u201cWho is to separate us, pray? They\u2019ll meet the fate of\nMilo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every\nLinton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could\nconsent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that\u2019s not what I intend\u2014that\u2019s not\nwhat I mean! I shouldn\u2019t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!\nHe\u2019ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must\nshake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he\nlearns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a\nselfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I\nmarried, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid\nHeathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother\u2019s power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith your husband\u2019s money, Miss Catherine?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll find him\nnot so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I\u2019m hardly a judge, I\nthink that\u2019s the worst motive you\u2019ve given yet for being the wife of\nyoung Linton.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d retorted she; \u201cit is the best! The others were the\nsatisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar\u2019s sake, too, to satisfy him.\nThis is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings\nto Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody\nhave a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond\nyou. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained\nhere? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff\u2019s miseries,\nand I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in\nliving is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should\nstill continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were\nannihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not\nseem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:\ntime will change it, I\u2019m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My\nlove for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of\nlittle visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He\u2019s\nalways, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always\na pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don\u2019t talk of our\nseparation again: it is impracticable; and\u2014\u201d\n\nShe paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\nforcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!\n\n\u201cIf I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,\u201d I said, \u201cit only goes\nto convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in\nmarrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble\nme with no more secrets: I\u2019ll not promise to keep them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll keep that?\u201d she asked, eagerly.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll not promise,\u201d I repeated.\n\nShe was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our\nconversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed\nHareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my\nfellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.\nHindley; and we didn\u2019t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came\nto the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we\nfeared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time\nalone.\n\n\u201cAnd how isn\u2019t that nowt comed in fro\u2019 th\u2019 field, be this time? What is\nhe about? girt idle seeght!\u201d demanded the old man, looking round for\nHeathcliff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d I replied. \u201cHe\u2019s in the barn, I\u2019ve no doubt.\u201d\n\nI went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to\nCatherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;\nand told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her\nbrother\u2019s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung\nHareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not\ntaking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk\nwould have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph\nproposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were\nstaying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They\nwere \u201cill eneugh for ony fahl manners,\u201d he affirmed. And on their\nbehalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual\nquarter-of-an-hour\u2019s supplication before meat, and would have tacked\nanother to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in\nupon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,\nwherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!\n\n\u201cI want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not\nreply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.\u201d\n\nJoseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to\nsuffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and\nwalked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the\nfloor, exclaiming\u2014\u201cI wonder where he is\u2014I wonder where he _can_ be!\nWhat did I say, Nelly? I\u2019ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour\nthis afternoon? Dear! tell me what I\u2019ve said to grieve him? I do wish\nhe\u2019d come. I do wish he would!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a noise for nothing!\u201d I cried, though rather uneasy myself. \u201cWhat\na trifle scares you! It\u2019s surely no great cause of alarm that\nHeathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie\ntoo sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I\u2019ll engage he\u2019s lurking\nthere. See if I don\u2019t ferret him out!\u201d\n\nI departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and\nJoseph\u2019s quest ended in the same.\n\n\u201cYon lad gets war und war!\u201d observed he on re-entering. \u201cHe\u2019s left th\u2019\ngate at t\u2019 full swing, and Miss\u2019s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o\u2019\ncorn, and plottered through, raight o\u2019er into t\u2019 meadow! Hahsomdiver,\nt\u2019 maister \u2019ull play t\u2019 devil to-morn, and he\u2019ll do weel. He\u2019s patience\nitsseln wi\u2019 sich careless, offald craters\u2014patience itsseln he is! Bud\nhe\u2019ll not be soa allus\u2014yah\u2019s see, all on ye! Yah mun\u2019n\u2019t drive him out\nof his heead for nowt!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you found Heathcliff, you ass?\u201d interrupted Catherine. \u201cHave you\nbeen looking for him, as I ordered?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sud more likker look for th\u2019 horse,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt \u2019ud be to more\nsense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike\nthis\u2014as black as t\u2019 chimbley! und Heathcliff\u2019s noan t\u2019 chap to coom at\n_my_ whistle\u2014happen he\u2019ll be less hard o\u2019 hearing wi\u2019 _ye_!\u201d\n\nIt _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined\nto thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain\nwould be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However,\nCatherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering\nto and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which\npermitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one\nside of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations\nand the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash\naround her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and\nthen crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good\npassionate fit of crying.\n\nAbout midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the\nHeights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and\neither one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:\na huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the\neast chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the\nkitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and\nJoseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the\npatriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,\nthough he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a\njudgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I\nshook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet\nliving. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion\nvociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might\nbe drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But\nthe uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;\nexcepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in\nrefusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to\ncatch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in\nand lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to\nthe back, and putting her hands before it.\n\n\u201cWell, Miss!\u201d I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; \u201cyou are not bent on\ngetting your death, are you? Do you know what o\u2019clock it is? Half-past\ntwelve. Come, come to bed! there\u2019s no use waiting any longer on that\nfoolish boy: he\u2019ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he\u2019ll stay there now. He\nguesses we shouldn\u2019t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he\nguesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he\u2019d rather avoid having\nthe door opened by the master.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, nay, he\u2019s noan at Gimmerton,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI\u2019s niver wonder but\nhe\u2019s at t\u2019 bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn\u2019t for nowt, and\nI wod hev\u2019 ye to look out, Miss\u2014yah muh be t\u2019 next. Thank Hivin for\nall! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out\nfro\u2019 th\u2019 rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t\u2019 Scripture ses.\u201d And he began\nquoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we\nmight find them.\n\nI, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet\nthings, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed\nwith little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping\nround him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I\ndistinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.\n\nComing down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing\nthe chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the\nfireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its\nunclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen\nhearth, haggard and drowsy.\n\n\u201cWhat ails you, Cathy?\u201d he was saying when I entered: \u201cyou look as\ndismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wet,\u201d she answered reluctantly, \u201cand I\u2019m cold, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, she is naughty!\u201d I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably\nsober. \u201cShe got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there\nshe has sat the night through, and I couldn\u2019t prevail on her to stir.\u201d\n\nMr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. \u201cThe night through,\u201d he\nrepeated. \u201cWhat kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was\nover hours since.\u201d\n\nNeither of us wished to mention Heathcliff\u2019s absence, as long as we\ncould conceal it; so I replied, I didn\u2019t know how she took it into her\nhead to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I\nthrew back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents\nfrom the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, \u201cEllen, shut the\nwindow. I\u2019m starving!\u201d And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to\nthe almost extinguished embers.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ill,\u201d said Hindley, taking her wrist; \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the\nreason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don\u2019t want to be troubled\nwith more sickness here. What took you into the rain?\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning after t\u2019 lads, as usuald!\u201d croaked Joseph, catching an\nopportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. \u201cIf I war\nyah, maister, I\u2019d just slam t\u2019 boards i\u2019 their faces all on \u2019em, gentle\nand simple! Never a day ut yah\u2019re off, but yon cat o\u2019 Linton comes\nsneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo\u2019s a fine lass! shoo sits watching\nfor ye i\u2019 t\u2019 kitchen; and as yah\u2019re in at one door, he\u2019s out at\nt\u2019other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It\u2019s\nbonny behaviour, lurking amang t\u2019 fields, after twelve o\u2019 t\u2019 night, wi\u2019\nthat fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I\u2019m_\nblind; but I\u2019m noan: nowt ut t\u2019 soart!\u2014I seed young Linton boath coming\nand going, and I seed _yah_\u201d (directing his discourse to me), \u201cyah\ngooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th\u2019 house, t\u2019\nminute yah heard t\u2019 maister\u2019s horse-fit clatter up t\u2019 road.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence, eavesdropper!\u201d cried Catherine; \u201cnone of your insolence\nbefore me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was\n_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have\nmet him as you were.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lie, Cathy, no doubt,\u201d answered her brother, \u201cand you are a\nconfounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were\nyou not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not\nbe afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me\na good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of\nbreaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business\nthis very morning; and after he\u2019s gone, I\u2019d advise you all to look\nsharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never saw Heathcliff last night,\u201d answered Catherine, beginning to\nsob bitterly: \u201cand if you do turn him out of doors, I\u2019ll go with him.\nBut, perhaps, you\u2019ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he\u2019s gone.\u201d\nHere she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her\nwords were inarticulate.\n\nHindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get\nto her room immediately, or she shouldn\u2019t cry for nothing! I obliged\nher to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we\nreached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and\nI begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of\ndelirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her\ndangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let\nher live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw\nherself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had\nenough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary\ndistance between cottage and cottage.\n\nThough I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master\nwere no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong\nas a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid\nus several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded\nand ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted\non conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were\nvery grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness:\nshe and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of\neach other.\n\nOur young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and\nhaughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the\nevening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when\nshe had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance\non her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period,\nfor several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save\nin the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he\n_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a\nlittle girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and\nthought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with\nconsideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear\ncrossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less\nthan murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and\ncontradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;\nand tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often\nattended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to\ndemand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was\nrather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,\nbut from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the\nfamily by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him\nalone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar\nLinton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was\ninfatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he\nled her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father\u2019s\ndeath.\n\nMuch against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights\nand accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I\nhad just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but\nCatherine\u2019s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,\nand when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting\nto her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the\nlatter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,\nnow that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should\ntake him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as\nI was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only\nto run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and\nsince then he has been a stranger: and it\u2019s very queer to think it, but\nI\u2019ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and\nthat he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nAt this point of the housekeeper\u2019s story she chanced to glance towards\nthe time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the\nminute-hand measure half-past one. She would not hear of staying a\nsecond longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of\nher narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I\nhave meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go\nalso, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nA charming introduction to a hermit\u2019s life! Four weeks\u2019 torture,\ntossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,\nand impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this\ndearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible\nintimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till\nspring!\n\nMr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago\nhe sent me a brace of grouse\u2014the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is\nnot altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a\ngreat mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was\ncharitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some\nother subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is\nquite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could\nenjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her\ntale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes:\nI remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three\nyears; and the heroine was married. I\u2019ll ring: she\u2019ll be delighted to\nfind me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.\n\n\u201cIt wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,\u201d she commenced.\n\n\u201cAway, away with it!\u201d I replied; \u201cI desire to have\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor says you must drop the powders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart! Don\u2019t interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.\nKeep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting\nout of your pocket\u2014that will do\u2014now continue the history of Mr.\nHeathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish\nhis education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he\nget a sizar\u2019s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours\nby drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more\npromptly on the English highways?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I\ncouldn\u2019t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn\u2019t know how\nhe gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise\nhis mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with\nyour leave, I\u2019ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse\nand not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nI got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my\nagreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to\nexpect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his\nsister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to\nher comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the\nhoneysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no\nmutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who\n_can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither\nopposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a\ndeep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but\nif ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow\ncloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a\nfrown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a\ntime spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab\nof a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing\nhis lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less\ntouchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as\nharmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine\nhad seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with\nsympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration\nin her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never\nsubject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was\nwelcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that\nthey were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.\n\nIt ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild\nand generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it\nended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one\u2019s interest\nwas not the chief consideration in the other\u2019s thoughts. On a mellow\nevening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket\nof apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon\nlooked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to\nlurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the\nbuilding. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and\nlingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet\nair; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I\nheard a voice behind me say,\u2014\u201cNelly, is that you?\u201d\n\nIt was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in\nthe manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I\nturned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut,\nand I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in\nthe porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in\ndark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and\nheld his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. \u201cWho\ncan it be?\u201d I thought. \u201cMr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no\nresemblance to his.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have waited here an hour,\u201d he resumed, while I continued staring;\n\u201cand the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I\ndared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I\u2019m not a stranger!\u201d\n\nA ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered\nwith black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and\nsingular. I remembered the eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,\nand I raised my hands in amazement. \u201cWhat! you come back? Is it really\nyou? Is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Heathcliff,\u201d he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,\nwhich reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from\nwithin. \u201cAre they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you\nneedn\u2019t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word\nwith her\u2014your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires\nto see her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow will she take it?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat will she do? The surprise\nbewilders me\u2014it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!\nBut altered! Nay, there\u2019s no comprehending it. Have you been for a\nsoldier?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo and carry my message,\u201d he interrupted, impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m in hell\ntill you do!\u201d\n\nHe lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where\nMr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At\nlength I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the\ncandles lighted, and I opened the door.\n\nThey sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,\nand displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the\nvalley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top\n(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the\nsough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of\nthe glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our\nold house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both\nthe room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked\nwondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;\nand was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my\nquestion about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to\nreturn, and mutter, \u201cA person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d asked Mrs. Linton.\n\n\u201cI did not question him,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cWell, close the curtains, Nelly,\u201d she said; \u201cand bring up tea. I\u2019ll be\nback again directly.\u201d\n\nShe quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.\n\n\u201cSome one mistress does not expect,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat Heathcliff\u2014you\nrecollect him, sir\u2014who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! the gipsy\u2014the ploughboy?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy did you not say so to\nCatherine?\u201d\n\n\u201cHush! you must not call him by those names, master,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019d be\nsadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.\nI guess his return will make a jubilee to her.\u201d\n\nMr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that\noverlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they\nwere below, for he exclaimed quickly: \u201cDon\u2019t stand there, love! Bring\nthe person in, if it be anyone particular.\u201d Ere long, I heard the click\nof the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too\nexcited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have\nsurmised an awful calamity.\n\n\u201cOh, Edgar, Edgar!\u201d she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. \u201cOh,\nEdgar darling! Heathcliff\u2019s come back\u2014he is!\u201d And she tightened her\nembrace to a squeeze.\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d cried her husband, crossly, \u201cdon\u2019t strangle me for that!\nHe never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to\nbe frantic!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t like him,\u201d she answered, repressing a little the\nintensity of her delight. \u201cYet, for my sake, you must be friends now.\nShall I tell him to come up?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cinto the parlour?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere else?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for\nhim. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression\u2014half angry, half\nlaughing at his fastidiousness.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she added, after a while; \u201cI cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two\ntables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being\ngentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.\nWill that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If\nso, give directions. I\u2019ll run down and secure my guest. I\u2019m afraid the\njoy is too great to be real!\u201d\n\nShe was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.\n\n\u201c_You_ bid him step up,\u201d he said, addressing me; \u201cand, Catherine, try\nto be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness\nthe sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.\u201d\n\nI descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently\nanticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without\nwaste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and\nmistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the\nlady\u2019s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the\ndoor: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;\nand then she seized Linton\u2019s reluctant fingers and crushed them into\nhis. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,\nmore than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had\ngrown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed\nquite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea\nof his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in\nexpression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton\u2019s; it looked\nintelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A\nhalf-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full\nof black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:\nquite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master\u2019s\nsurprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss\nhow to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped\nhis slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to\nspeak.\n\n\u201cSit down, sir,\u201d he said, at length. \u201cMrs. Linton, recalling old times,\nwould have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am\ngratified when anything occurs to please her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I also,\u201d answered Heathcliff, \u201cespecially if it be anything in\nwhich I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.\u201d\n\nHe took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if\nshe feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his\nto her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed\nback, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from\nhers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer\nembarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a\nfeeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across\nthe rug, seized Heathcliff\u2019s hands again, and laughed like one beside\nherself.\n\n\u201cI shall think it a dream to-morrow!\u201d she cried. \u201cI shall not be able\nto believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.\nAnd yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don\u2019t deserve this welcome. To be absent\nand silent for three years, and never to think of me!\u201d\n\n\u201cA little more than you have thought of me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI heard of\nyour marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard\nbelow, I meditated this plan\u2014just to have one glimpse of your face, a\nstare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle\nmy score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on\nmyself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of\nmeeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you\u2019ll not drive me off\nagain. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.\nI\u2019ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and\nyou must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cCatherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the\ntable,\u201d interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and\na due measure of politeness. \u201cMr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,\nwherever he may lodge to-night; and I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d\n\nShe took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by\nthe bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.\nThe meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine\u2019s cup was never filled:\nshe could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,\nand scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his\nstay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he\nwent to Gimmerton?\n\n\u201cNo, to Wuthering Heights,\u201d he answered: \u201cMr. Earnshaw invited me, when\nI called this morning.\u201d\n\nMr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered\nthis sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of\na hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a\ncloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he\nhad better have remained away.\n\nAbout the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.\nLinton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and\npulling me by the hair to rouse me.\n\n\u201cI cannot rest, Ellen,\u201d she said, by way of apology. \u201cAnd I want some\nliving creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,\nbecause I\u2019m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to\nopen his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he\naffirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so\nsick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I\ngave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for\na headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat use is it praising Heathcliff to him?\u201d I answered. \u201cAs lads they\nhad an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much\nto hear him praised: it\u2019s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him,\nunless you would like an open quarrel between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut does it not show great weakness?\u201d pursued she. \u201cI\u2019m not envious: I\nnever feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella\u2019s yellow hair and the\nwhiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the\nfamily exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute\nsometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish\nmother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It\npleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they\nare very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was\nmade for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart\nchastisement might improve them all the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,\u201d said I. \u201cThey humour you: I know what\nthere would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge\ntheir passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your\ndesires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal\nconsequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very\ncapable of being as obstinate as you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we shall fight to the death, sha\u2019n\u2019t we, Nelly?\u201d she\nreturned, laughing. \u201cNo! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton\u2019s\nlove, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn\u2019t wish to\nretaliate.\u201d\n\nI advised her to value him the more for his affection.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut he needn\u2019t resort to whining for trifles. It\nis childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that\nHeathcliff was now worthy of anyone\u2019s regard, and it would honour the\nfirst gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said\nit for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to\nhim, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason\nto object to him, I\u2019m sure he behaved excellently!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?\u201d I inquired. \u201cHe\nis reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering\nthe right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe explained it,\u201d she replied. \u201cI wonder as much as you. He said he\ncalled to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you\nresided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to\nquestioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;\nand finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at\ncards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,\nfinding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again\nin the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to\nselect his acquaintance prudently: he doesn\u2019t trouble himself to\nreflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has\nbasely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for\nresuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install\nhimself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an\nattachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope\nthat I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could\nhave if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for\npermission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother\u2019s\ncovetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;\nthough what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!\u201d said I.\n\u201cHave you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone for my friend,\u201d she replied: \u201chis strong head will keep him from\ndanger; a little for Hindley: but he can\u2019t be made morally worse than\nhe is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this\nevening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry\nrebellion against Providence. Oh, I\u2019ve endured very, very bitter\nmisery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he\u2019d be ashamed to\ncloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which\ninduced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently\nfelt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently\nas I. However, it\u2019s over, and I\u2019ll take no revenge on his folly; I can\nafford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive\nslap me on the cheek, I\u2019d not only turn the other, but I\u2019d ask pardon\nfor provoking it; and, as a proof, I\u2019ll go make my peace with Edgar\ninstantly. Good-night! I\u2019m an angel!\u201d\n\nIn this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her\nfulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only\nabjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by\nCatherine\u2019s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to\nher taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and\nshe rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in\nreturn as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and\nservants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.\n\nHeathcliff\u2014Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future\u2014used the liberty of\nvisiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed\nestimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also,\ndeemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in\nreceiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.\nHe retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was\nremarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of\nfeeling. My master\u2019s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further\ncircumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.\n\nHis new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of\nIsabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards\nthe tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of\neighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen\nfeelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved\nher tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside\nthe degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible\nfact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such\na one\u2019s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff\u2019s disposition: to\nknow that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable\nand unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank\nforebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He\nwould have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment\nrose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation\nof sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the\nblame on Heathcliff\u2019s deliberate designing.\n\nWe had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and\npined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and\nteasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her\nlimited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of\nill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,\nwhen she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,\ncomplaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the\nmistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar\nneglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left\nopen, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a\nhundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily\ninsisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,\nthreatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to\nexclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only\nCatherine\u2019s harshness which made her unhappy.\n\n\u201cHow can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?\u201d cried the mistress,\namazed at the unreasonable assertion. \u201cYou are surely losing your\nreason. When have I been harsh, tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d sobbed Isabella, \u201cand now!\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday!\u201d said her sister-in-law. \u201cOn what occasion?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,\nwhile you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s your notion of harshness?\u201d said Catherine, laughing. \u201cIt\nwas no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn\u2019t care whether\nyou kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff\u2019s talk would have\nnothing entertaining for your ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d wept the young lady; \u201cyou wished me away, because you knew I\nliked to be there!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she sane?\u201d asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. \u201cI\u2019ll repeat our\nconversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it\ncould have had for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind the conversation,\u201d she answered: \u201cI wanted to be with\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the\nsentence.\n\n\u201cWith him: and I won\u2019t be always sent off!\u201d she continued, kindling up.\n\u201cYou are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but\nyourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are an impertinent little monkey!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\nsurprise. \u201cBut I\u2019ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you\ncan covet the admiration of Heathcliff\u2014that you consider him an\nagreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you have not,\u201d said the infatuated girl. \u201cI love him more than\never you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be you for a kingdom, then!\u201d Catherine declared,\nemphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. \u201cNelly, help me to\nconvince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an\nunreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid\nwilderness of furze and whinstone. I\u2019d as soon put that little canary\ninto the park on a winter\u2019s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart\non him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing\nelse, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don\u2019t imagine that\nhe conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern\nexterior! He\u2019s not a rough diamond\u2014a pearl-containing oyster of a\nrustic: he\u2019s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, \u2018Let\nthis or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to\nharm them;\u2019 I say, \u2018Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be\nwronged:\u2019 and he\u2019d crush you like a sparrow\u2019s egg, Isabella, if he\nfound you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn\u2019t love a Linton; and\nyet he\u2019d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:\navarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There\u2019s my picture: and\nI\u2019m his friend\u2014so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,\nI should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his\ntrap.\u201d\n\nMiss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.\n\n\u201cFor shame! for shame!\u201d she repeated, angrily. \u201cYou are worse than\ntwenty foes, you poisonous friend!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! you won\u2019t believe me, then?\u201d said Catherine. \u201cYou think I speak\nfrom wicked selfishness?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain you do,\u201d retorted Isabella; \u201cand I shudder at you!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d cried the other. \u201cTry for yourself, if that be your spirit: I\nhave done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd I must suffer for her egotism!\u201d she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left\nthe room. \u201cAll, all is against me: she has blighted my single\nconsolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn\u2019t she? Mr. Heathcliff is\nnot a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he\nremember her?\u201d\n\n\u201cBanish him from your thoughts, Miss,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bird of bad\nomen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can\u2019t\ncontradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any\none besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.\nHonest people don\u2019t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has\nhe got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man\nwhom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.\nThey sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been\nborrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I\nheard only a week ago\u2014it was Joseph who told me\u2014I met him at Gimmerton:\n\u2018Nelly,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\u2019s hae a crowner\u2019s \u2019quest enow, at ahr folks\u2019. One\non \u2019em \u2019s a\u2019most getten his finger cut off wi\u2019 hauding t\u2019 other fro\u2019\nstickin\u2019 hisseln loike a cawlf. That\u2019s maister, yah knaw, \u2019at \u2019s soa\nup o\u2019 going tuh t\u2019 grand \u2019sizes. He\u2019s noan feared o\u2019 t\u2019 bench o\u2019\njudges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on\n\u2019em, not he! He fair likes\u2014he langs to set his brazened face agean \u2019em!\nAnd yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he\u2019s a rare \u2019un. He can girn a\nlaugh as well \u2019s onybody at a raight divil\u2019s jest. Does he niver say\nnowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t\u2019 Grange? This is t\u2019\nway on \u2019t:\u2014up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und\ncan\u2019le-light till next day at noon: then, t\u2019 fooil gangs banning un\nraving to his cham\u2019er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i\u2019 thur\nlugs fur varry shame; un\u2019 the knave, why he can caint his brass, un\u2019\nate, un\u2019 sleep, un\u2019 off to his neighbour\u2019s to gossip wi\u2019 t\u2019 wife. I\u2019\ncourse, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur\u2019s goold runs into his\npocket, and her fathur\u2019s son gallops down t\u2019 broad road, while he flees\nafore to oppen t\u2019 pikes!\u2019 Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,\nbut no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff\u2019s conduct be true, you\nwould never think of desiring such a husband, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are leagued with the rest, Ellen!\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ll not listen\nto your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me\nthat there is no happiness in the world!\u201d\n\nWhether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or\npersevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time\nto reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next\ntown; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his\nabsence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were\nsitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter\nalarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of\nher secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on\nmature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she\nlaughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter\nto _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was\nsweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.\nIsabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the\ndoor opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would\ngladly have done had it been practicable.\n\n\u201cCome in, that\u2019s right!\u201d exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair\nto the fire. \u201cHere are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the\nice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.\nHeathcliff, I\u2019m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you\nmore than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it\u2019s not Nelly;\ndon\u2019t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart\nby mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in\nyour own power to be Edgar\u2019s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha\u2019n\u2019t run\noff,\u201d she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the\nconfounded girl, who had risen indignantly. \u201cWe were quarrelling like\ncats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of\ndevotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would\nbut have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself\nto be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,\nand send my image into eternal oblivion!\u201d\n\n\u201cCatherine!\u201d said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to\nstruggle from the tight grasp that held her, \u201cI\u2019d thank you to adhere\nto the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind\nenough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and\nI are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me\nbeyond expression.\u201d\n\nAs the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly\nindifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned\nand whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.\n\n\u201cBy no means!\u201d cried Mrs. Linton in answer. \u201cI won\u2019t be named a dog in\nthe manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don\u2019t you\nevince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love\nEdgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I\u2019m sure\nshe made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has\nfasted ever since the day before yesterday\u2019s walk, from sorrow and rage\nthat I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being\nunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you belie her,\u201d said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face\nthem. \u201cShe wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!\u201d\n\nAnd he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a\nstrange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,\nwhich curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it\nraises. The poor thing couldn\u2019t bear that; she grew white and red in\nrapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength\nof her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and\nperceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another\nclosed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to\nmake use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the\ndetainer\u2019s with crescents of red.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tigress!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and\nshaking her hand with pain. \u201cBegone, for God\u2019s sake, and hide your\nvixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can\u2019t you\nfancy the conclusions he\u2019ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are\ninstruments that will do execution\u2014you must beware of your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,\u201d he\nanswered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. \u201cBut what did\nyou mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not\nspeaking the truth, were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you I was,\u201d she returned. \u201cShe has been dying for your sake\nseveral weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a\ndeluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,\nfor the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don\u2019t notice it\nfurther: I wished to punish her sauciness, that\u2019s all. I like her too\nwell, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I like her too ill to attempt it,\u201d said he, \u201cexcept in a very\nghoulish fashion. You\u2019d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that\nmawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white\nthe colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day\nor two: they detestably resemble Linton\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelectably!\u201d observed Catherine. \u201cThey are dove\u2019s eyes\u2014angel\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s her brother\u2019s heir, is she not?\u201d he asked, after a brief\nsilence.\n\n\u201cI should be sorry to think so,\u201d returned his companion. \u201cHalf a dozen\nnephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from\nthe subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour\u2019s\ngoods; remember _this_ neighbour\u2019s goods are mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,\u201d said\nHeathcliff; \u201cbut though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely\nmad; and, in short, we\u2019ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.\u201d\n\nFrom their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from\nher thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the\ncourse of the evening. I saw him smile to himself\u2014grin rather\u2014and lapse\ninto ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from\nthe apartment.\n\nI determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the\nmaster\u2019s, in preference to Catherine\u2019s side: with reason I imagined,\nfor he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she\u2014she could not be\ncalled the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide\nlatitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less\nsympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might\nhave the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr.\nHeathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His\nvisits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master\nalso. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I\nfelt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked\nwanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting\nhis time to spring and destroy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nSometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I\u2019ve got up in\na sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the\nfarm. I\u2019ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how\npeople talked regarding his ways; and then I\u2019ve recollected his\nconfirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched\nfrom re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken\nat my word.\n\nOne time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to\nGimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a\nbright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I\ncame to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your\nleft hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north\nside, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a\nguide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone\nyellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,\nbut all at once a gush of child\u2019s sensations flowed into my heart.\nHindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed\nlong at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole\nnear the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were\nfond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as\nreality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the\nwithered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand\nscooping out the earth with a piece of slate. \u201cPoor Hindley!\u201d I\nexclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a\nmomentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight\ninto mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an\nirresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to\ncomply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought\u2014or\nshould die soon!\u2014supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to\nthe house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I\ntrembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood\nlooking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an\nelf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the\nbars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,\nnot altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.\n\n\u201cGod bless thee, darling!\u201d I cried, forgetting instantaneously my\nfoolish fears. \u201cHareton, it\u2019s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.\u201d\n\nHe retreated out of arm\u2019s length, and picked up a large flint.\n\n\u201cI am come to see thy father, Hareton,\u201d I added, guessing from the\naction that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not\nrecognised as one with me.\n\nHe raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but\ncould not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,\nfrom the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,\nwhich, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with\npractised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking\nexpression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than\nangered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it\nto propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as\nif he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed\nanother, keeping it out of his reach.\n\n\u201cWho has taught you those fine words, my bairn?\u201d I inquired. \u201cThe\ncurate?\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cTell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,\u201d said I.\n\u201cWho\u2019s your master?\u201d\n\n\u201cDevil daddy,\u201d was his answer.\n\n\u201cAnd what do you learn from daddy?\u201d I continued.\n\nHe jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. \u201cWhat does he teach you?\u201d I\nasked.\n\n\u201cNaught,\u201d said he, \u201cbut to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me,\nbecause I swear at him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?\u201d I observed.\n\n\u201cAy\u2014nay,\u201d he drawled.\n\n\u201cWho, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeathcliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy!\u201d he answered again.\n\nDesiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the\nsentences\u2014\u201cI known\u2019t: he pays dad back what he gies to me\u2014he curses\ndaddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?\u201d I pursued.\n\n\u201cNo, I was told the curate should have his \u2014\u2014 teeth dashed down his \u2014\u2014\nthroat, if he stepped over the threshold\u2014Heathcliff had promised that!\u201d\n\nI put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman\ncalled Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He\nwent up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,\nHeathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran\ndown the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I\ngained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a\ngoblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella\u2019s affair: except\nthat it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and\ndoing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the\nGrange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs.\nLinton\u2019s pleasure.\n\nThe next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some\npigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law\nfor three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,\nand we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of\nbestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as\nsoon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping\nsurvey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I\ndrew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said\nsomething: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to\nprevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he\napparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was\nanother rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the\nscoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.\n\n\u201cJudas! Traitor!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cYou are a hypocrite, too, are you? A\ndeliberate deceiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is, Nelly?\u201d said Catherine\u2019s voice at my elbow: I had been\nover-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.\n\n\u201cYour worthless friend!\u201d I answered, warmly: \u201cthe sneaking rascal\nyonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us\u2014he is coming in! I wonder\nwill he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to\nMiss, when he told you he hated her?\u201d\n\nMrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;\nand a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn\u2019t withhold\ngiving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on\nsilence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to\nbe so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.\n\n\u201cTo hear you, people might think you were the mistress!\u201d she cried.\n\u201cYou want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you\nabout, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!\u2014I beg you\nwill, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to\ndraw the bolts against you!\u201d\n\n\u201cGod forbid that he should try!\u201d answered the black villain. I detested\nhim just then. \u201cGod keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder\nafter sending him to heaven!\u201d\n\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Catherine, shutting the inner door. \u201cDon\u2019t vex me. Why\nhave you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it to you?\u201d he growled. \u201cI have a right to kiss her, if she\nchooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband:\n_you_ needn\u2019t be jealous of me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not jealous of you,\u201d replied the mistress; \u201cI\u2019m jealous for you.\nClear your face: you sha\u2019n\u2019t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you\nshall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!\nThere, you won\u2019t answer. I\u2019m certain you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?\u201d I\ninquired.\n\n\u201cMr. Linton should approve,\u201d returned my lady, decisively.\n\n\u201cHe might spare himself the trouble,\u201d said Heathcliff: \u201cI could do as\nwell without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind\nto speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware\nthat I _know_ you have treated me infernally\u2014infernally! Do you hear?\nAnd if you flatter yourself that I don\u2019t perceive it, you are a fool;\nand if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:\nand if you fancy I\u2019ll suffer unrevenged, I\u2019ll convince you of the\ncontrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me\nyour sister-in-law\u2019s secret: I swear I\u2019ll make the most of it. And\nstand you aside!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat new phase of his character is this?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\namazement. \u201cI\u2019ve treated you infernally\u2014and you\u2019ll take your revenge!\nHow will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you\ninfernally?\u201d\n\n\u201cI seek no revenge on you,\u201d replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don\u2019t\nturn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to\ntorture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a\nlittle in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are\nable. Having levelled my palace, don\u2019t erect a hovel and complacently\nadmire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you\nreally wished me to marry Isabel, I\u2019d cut my throat!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?\u201d cried Catherine.\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering\nSatan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You\nprove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your\ncoming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us\nat peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if\nyou please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you\u2019ll hit on exactly\nthe most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.\u201d\n\nThe conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and\ngloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could\nneither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms,\nbrooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek\nthe master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.\n\n\u201cEllen,\u201d said he, when I entered, \u201chave you seen your mistress?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; she\u2019s in the kitchen, sir,\u201d I answered. \u201cShe\u2019s sadly put out by\nMr. Heathcliff\u2019s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it\u2019s time to\narrange his visits on another footing. There\u2019s harm in being too soft,\nand now it\u2019s come to this\u2014.\u201d And I related the scene in the court, and,\nas near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could\nnot be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so\nafterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had\ndifficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he\ndid not clear his wife of blame.\n\n\u201cThis is insufferable!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIt is disgraceful that she\nshould own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two\nmen out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue\nwith the low ruffian\u2014I have humoured her enough.\u201d\n\nHe descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,\nfollowed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their\nangry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed\nvigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat\ncowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and\nmade a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,\nabruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.\n\n\u201cHow is this?\u201d said Linton, addressing her; \u201cwhat notion of propriety\nmust you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to\nyou by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you\nthink nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,\nimagine I can get used to it too!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been listening at the door, Edgar?\u201d asked the mistress, in a\ntone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both\ncarelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised\nhis eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on\npurpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton\u2019s attention to him. He\nsucceeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high\nflights of passion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,\u201d he said quietly; \u201cnot that\nI was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you\nwere only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up\nyour acquaintance, I acquiesced\u2014foolishly. Your presence is a moral\npoison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to\nprevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into\nthis house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.\nThree minutes\u2019 delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.\u201d\n\nHeathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye\nfull of derision.\n\n\u201cCathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!\u201d he said. \u201cIt is in\ndanger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,\nI\u2019m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!\u201d\n\nMy master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:\nhe had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the\nhint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I\nattempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and\nlocked it.\n\n\u201cFair means!\u201d she said, in answer to her husband\u2019s look of angry\nsurprise. \u201cIf you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or\nallow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more\nvalour than you possess. No, I\u2019ll swallow the key before you shall get\nit! I\u2019m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant\nindulgence of one\u2019s weak nature, and the other\u2019s bad one, I earn for\nthanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I\nwas defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,\nfor daring to think an evil thought of me!\u201d\n\nIt did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the\nmaster. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine\u2019s grasp, and for\nsafety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.\nEdgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew\ndeadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:\nmingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on\nthe back of a chair, and covered his face.\n\n\u201cOh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!\u201d exclaimed\nMrs. Linton. \u201cWe are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as\nsoon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a\ncolony of mice. Cheer up! you sha\u2019n\u2019t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,\nit\u2019s a sucking leveret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!\u201d said her friend. \u201cI\ncompliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering\nthing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I\u2019d\nkick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he\nweeping, or is he going to faint for fear?\u201d\n\nThe fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.\nHe\u2019d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and\nstruck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a\nslighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr.\nLinton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to\nthe front entrance.\n\n\u201cThere! you\u2019ve done with coming here,\u201d cried Catherine. \u201cGet away, now;\nhe\u2019ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he\ndid overhear us, of course he\u2019d never forgive you. You\u2019ve played me an\nill turn, Heathcliff! But go\u2014make haste! I\u2019d rather see Edgar at bay\nthan you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m going with that blow burning in my gullet?\u201d he\nthundered. \u201cBy hell, no! I\u2019ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut\nbefore I cross the threshold! If I don\u2019t floor him now, I shall murder\nhim some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not coming,\u201d I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. \u201cThere\u2019s the\ncoachman and the two gardeners; you\u2019ll surely not wait to be thrust\ninto the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very\nlikely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil\nhis orders.\u201d\n\nThe gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They\nhad already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,\nresolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the\npoker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as\nthey tramped in.\n\nMrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.\nShe did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was\nanxious to keep her in ignorance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nearly distracted, Nelly!\u201d she exclaimed, throwing herself on the\nsofa. \u201cA thousand smiths\u2019 hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella\nto shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else\naggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to\nEdgar, if you see him again to-night, that I\u2019m in danger of being\nseriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed\nme shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin\na string of abuse or complainings; I\u2019m certain I should recriminate,\nand God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You\nare aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him\nto turn listener? Heathcliff\u2019s talk was outrageous, after you left us;\nbut I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant\nnothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool\u2019s craving to hear evil of\nself, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered\nour conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really,\nwhen he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I\nhad scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care\nhardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however\nthe scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how\nlong! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend\u2014if Edgar will be\nmean and jealous, I\u2019ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.\nThat will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to\nextremity! But it\u2019s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I\u2019d not\ntake Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in\ndreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that\npolicy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,\non frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that\ncountenance, and look rather more anxious about me.\u201d\n\nThe stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,\nrather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but\nI believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion\nto account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control\nherself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish\nto \u201cfrighten\u201d her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for\nthe purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I\nmet the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of\nturning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel\ntogether. He began to speak first.\n\n\u201cRemain where you are, Catherine,\u201d he said; without any anger in his\nvoice, but with much sorrowful despondency. \u201cI shall not stay. I am\nneither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn\nwhether, after this evening\u2019s events, you intend to continue your\nintimacy with\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, for mercy\u2019s sake,\u201d interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,\n\u201cfor mercy\u2019s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood\ncannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but\nmine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo get rid of me, answer my question,\u201d persevered Mr. Linton. \u201cYou\n_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found\nthat you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up\nHeathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you\nto be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely\n_require_ to know which you choose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI require to be let alone!\u201d exclaimed Catherine, furiously. \u201cI demand\nit! Don\u2019t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you\u2014you leave me!\u201d\n\nShe rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It\nwas enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!\nThere she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and\ngrinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to\nsplinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and\nfear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I\nbrought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her\nface. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up\nher eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the\naspect of death. Linton looked terrified.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the world the matter,\u201d I whispered. I did not want\nhim to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.\n\n\u201cShe has blood on her lips!\u201d he said, shuddering.\n\n\u201cNever mind!\u201d I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,\nprevious to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously\ngave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up\u2014her hair\nflying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck\nand arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken\nbones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then\nrushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her\nchamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against\nme.\n\nAs she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to\nask whether she would have some carried up. \u201cNo!\u201d she replied,\nperemptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and\nagain on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on\nhis part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning\nhis wife\u2019s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour\u2019s interview,\nduring which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper\nhorror for Heathcliff\u2019s advances: but he could make nothing of her\nevasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination\nunsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were\nso insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all\nbonds of relationship between herself and him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhile Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and\nalmost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books\nthat he never opened\u2014wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague\nexpectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her\nown accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation\u2014and _she_ fasted\npertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was\nready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running\nto cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,\nconvinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and\nthat lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any\nexpostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the\nsighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady\u2019s name, since he might\nnot hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased\nfor me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice\nat length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.\n\nMrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished\nthe water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a\nbasin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a\nspeech meant for Edgar\u2019s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it\nto myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank\neagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and\ngroaning. \u201cOh, I will die,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201csince no one cares anything\nabout me. I wish I had not taken that.\u201d Then a good while after I heard\nher murmur, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll not die\u2014he\u2019d be glad\u2014he does not love me at\nall\u2014he would never miss me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you want anything, ma\u2019am?\u201d I inquired, still preserving my\nexternal composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,\nexaggerated manner.\n\n\u201cWhat is that apathetic being doing?\u201d she demanded, pushing the thick\nentangled locks from her wasted face. \u201cHas he fallen into a lethargy,\nor is he dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d replied I; \u201cif you mean Mr. Linton. He\u2019s tolerably well, I\nthink, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is\ncontinually among his books, since he has no other society.\u201d\n\nI should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I\ncould not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.\n\n\u201cAmong his books!\u201d she cried, confounded. \u201cAnd I dying! I on the brink\nof the grave! My God! does he know how I\u2019m altered?\u201d continued she,\nstaring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite\nwall. \u201cIs that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet\u2014in play,\nperhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if\nit be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I\u2019ll choose\nbetween these two: either to starve at once\u2014that would be no punishment\nunless he had a heart\u2014or to recover, and leave the country. Are you\nspeaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly\nindifferent for my life?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered, \u201cthe master has no idea of your being\nderanged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die\nof hunger.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think not? Cannot you tell him I will?\u201d she returned. \u201cPersuade\nhim! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you forget, Mrs. Linton,\u201d I suggested, \u201cthat you have eaten some\nfood with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its\ngood effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were only sure it would kill him,\u201d she interrupted, \u201cI\u2019d kill\nmyself directly! These three awful nights I\u2019ve never closed my lids\u2014and\noh, I\u2019ve been tormented! I\u2019ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy\nyou don\u2019t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and\ndespised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all\nturned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I\u2019m positive; the people\n_here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!\nIsabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be\nso dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to\nsee it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace\nto his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all\nthat feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?\u201d\n\nShe could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.\nLinton\u2019s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her\nfeverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;\nthen raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the\nwindow. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the\nnorth-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her\nface, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and\nbrought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor\u2019s\ninjunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was\nviolent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey\nher, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from\nthe rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to\ntheir different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a turkey\u2019s,\u201d she murmured to herself; \u201cand this is a wild\nduck\u2019s; and this is a pigeon\u2019s. Ah, they put pigeons\u2019 feathers in the\npillows\u2014no wonder I couldn\u2019t die! Let me take care to throw it on the\nfloor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock\u2019s; and this\u2014I should\nknow it among a thousand\u2014it\u2019s a lapwing\u2019s. Bonny bird; wheeling over\nour heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for\nthe clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This\nfeather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its\nnest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap\nover it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he\u2019d never\nshoot a lapwing after that, and he didn\u2019t. Yes, here are more! Did he\nshoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive over with that baby-work!\u201d I interrupted, dragging the pillow\naway, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing\nits contents by handfuls. \u201cLie down and shut your eyes: you\u2019re\nwandering. There\u2019s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.\u201d\n\nI went here and there collecting it.\n\n\u201cI see in you, Nelly,\u201d she continued dreamily, \u201can aged woman: you have\ngrey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under\nPenistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;\npretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That\u2019s\nwhat you\u2019ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I\u2019m\nnot wandering: you\u2019re mistaken, or else I should believe you really\n_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone\nCrags; and I\u2019m conscious it\u2019s night, and there are two candles on the\ntable making the black press shine like jet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe black press? where is that?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are talking in your\nsleep!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s against the wall, as it always is,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt _does_\nappear odd\u2014I see a face in it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no press in the room, and never was,\u201d said I, resuming my\nseat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t _you_ see that face?\u201d she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\nmirror.\n\nAnd say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\nher own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s behind there still!\u201d she pursued, anxiously. \u201cAnd it stirred. Who\nis it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the\nroom is haunted! I\u2019m afraid of being alone!\u201d\n\nI took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of\nshudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze\ntowards the glass.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here!\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you\nknew it a while since.\u201d\n\n\u201cMyself!\u201d she gasped, \u201cand the clock is striking twelve! It\u2019s true,\nthen! that\u2019s dreadful!\u201d\n\nHer fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I\nattempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her\nhusband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek\u2014the shawl had\ndropped from the frame.\n\n\u201cWhy, what _is_ the matter?\u201d cried I. \u201cWho is coward now? Wake up! That\nis the glass\u2014the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and\nthere am I too by your side.\u201d\n\nTrembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually\npassed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of\nshame.\n\n\u201cOh, dear! I thought I was at home,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI thought I was lying\nin my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I\u2019m weak, my brain got\nconfused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don\u2019t say anything; but stay\nwith me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA sound sleep would do you good, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered: \u201cand I hope this\nsuffering will prevent your trying starving again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!\u201d she went on\nbitterly, wringing her hands. \u201cAnd that wind sounding in the firs by\nthe lattice. Do let me feel it\u2014it comes straight down the moor\u2014do let\nme have one breath!\u201d\n\nTo pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast\nrushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still\nnow, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued\nher spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.\n\n\u201cHow long is it since I shut myself in here?\u201d she asked, suddenly\nreviving.\n\n\u201cIt was Monday evening,\u201d I replied, \u201cand this is Thursday night, or\nrather Friday morning, at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! of the same week?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cOnly that brief time?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,\u201d\nobserved I.\n\n\u201cWell, it seems a weary number of hours,\u201d she muttered doubtfully: \u201cit\nmust be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had\nquarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this\nroom desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness\noverwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn\u2019t explain to Edgar\nhow certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he\npersisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he\ndid not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to\nescape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see\nand hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I\u2019ll tell you what I\nthought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my\nreason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,\nand my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was\nenclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some\ngreat grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and\nworried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the\nwhole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that\nthey had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my\nmisery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me\nand Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from\na dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the\npanels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and\nthen memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of\ndespair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been\ntemporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at\ntwelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early\nassociation, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and\nbeen converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross\nGrange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,\nfrom what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where\nI grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to\nunsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and\ncompelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I\u2019m burning! I wish I were out of\ndoors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and\nlaughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed?\nwhy does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I\u2019m sure I\nshould be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the\nwindow again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don\u2019t you move?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I won\u2019t give you your death of cold,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t give me a chance of life, you mean,\u201d she said sullenly.\n\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not helpless yet; I\u2019ll open it myself.\u201d\n\nAnd sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the\nroom, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless\nof the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I\nentreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon\nfound her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,\nI became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no\nmoon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed\nfrom any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and\nthose at Wuthering Heights were never visible\u2014still she asserted she\ncaught their shining.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d she cried eagerly, \u201cthat\u2019s my room with the candle in it, and\nthe trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph\u2019s\ngarret. Joseph sits up late, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s waiting till I come home\nthat he may lock the gate. Well, he\u2019ll wait a while yet. It\u2019s a rough\njourney, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton\nKirk to go that journey! We\u2019ve braved its ghosts often together, and\ndared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But,\nHeathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I\u2019ll keep\nyou. I\u2019ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,\nand throw the church down over me, but I won\u2019t rest till you are with\nme. I never will!\u201d\n\nShe paused, and resumed with a strange smile. \u201cHe\u2019s considering\u2014he\u2019d\nrather I\u2019d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.\nYou are slow! Be content, you always followed me!\u201d\n\nPerceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I\ncould reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of\nherself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,\nto my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr.\nLinton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing\nthrough the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by\ncuriosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.\n\n\u201cOh, sir!\u201d I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the\nsight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. \u201cMy poor\nmistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;\npray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she\u2019s\nhard to guide any way but her own.\u201d\n\n\u201cCatherine ill?\u201d he said, hastening to us. \u201cShut the window, Ellen!\nCatherine! why\u2014\u201d\n\nHe was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton\u2019s appearance smote him\nspeechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified\nastonishment.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been fretting here,\u201d I continued, \u201cand eating scarcely anything,\nand never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,\nand so we couldn\u2019t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it\nourselves; but it is nothing.\u201d\n\nI felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. \u201cIt is\nnothing, is it, Ellen Dean?\u201d he said sternly. \u201cYou shall account more\nclearly for keeping me ignorant of this!\u201d And he took his wife in his\narms, and looked at her with anguish.\n\nAt first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her\nabstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her\neyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her\nattention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.\n\n\u201cAh! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?\u201d she said, with angry\nanimation. \u201cYou are one of those things that are ever found when least\nwanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty\nof lamentations now\u2014I see we shall\u2014but they can\u2019t keep me from my\nnarrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I\u2019m bound before spring\nis over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the\nchapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please\nyourself whether you go to them or come to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cCatherine, what have you done?\u201d commenced the master. \u201cAm I nothing to\nyou any more? Do you love that wretch Heath\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHush!\u201d cried Mrs. Linton. \u201cHush, this moment! You mention that name\nand I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you\ntouch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top\nbefore you lay hands on me again. I don\u2019t want you, Edgar: I\u2019m past\nwanting you. Return to your books. I\u2019m glad you possess a consolation,\nfor all you had in me is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer mind wanders, sir,\u201d I interposed. \u201cShe has been talking nonsense\nthe whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and\nshe\u2019ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI desire no further advice from you,\u201d answered Mr. Linton. \u201cYou knew\nyour mistress\u2019s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to\ngive me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was\nheartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!\u201d\n\nI began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for\nanother\u2019s wicked waywardness. \u201cI knew Mrs. Linton\u2019s nature to be\nheadstrong and domineering,\u201d cried I: \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know that you\nwished to foster her fierce temper! I didn\u2019t know that, to humour her,\nI should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful\nservant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant\u2019s wages!\nWell, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may\ngather intelligence for yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen\nDean,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?\u201d said\nI. \u201cHeathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to\ndrop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison\nthe mistress against you?\u201d\n\nConfused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our\nconversation.\n\n\u201cAh! Nelly has played traitor,\u201d she exclaimed, passionately. \u201cNelly is\nmy hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me\ngo, and I\u2019ll make her rue! I\u2019ll make her howl a recantation!\u201d\n\nA maniac\u2019s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to\ndisengage herself from Linton\u2019s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry\nthe event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,\nI quitted the chamber.\n\nIn passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook\nis driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,\nevidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I\nstayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction\nimpressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.\nMy surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more\nthan vision, Miss Isabella\u2019s springer, Fanny, suspended by a\nhandkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the\nanimal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its\nmistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could\nhave got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.\nWhile untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I\nrepeatedly caught the beat of horses\u2019 feet galloping at some distance;\nbut there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I\nhardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,\nin that place, at two o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a\npatient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of\nCatherine Linton\u2019s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.\nHe was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of\nher surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to\nhis directions than she had shown herself before.\n\n\u201cNelly Dean,\u201d said he, \u201cI can\u2019t help fancying there\u2019s an extra cause\nfor this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We\u2019ve odd reports up\nhere. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a\ntrifle; and that sort of people should not either. It\u2019s hard work\nbringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe master will inform you,\u201d I answered; \u201cbut you are acquainted with\nthe Earnshaws\u2019 violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I\nmay say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a\ntempest of passion with a kind of fit. That\u2019s her account, at least:\nfor she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.\nAfterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and\nremains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind\nfilled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Linton will be sorry?\u201d observed Kenneth, interrogatively.\n\n\u201cSorry? he\u2019ll break his heart should anything happen!\u201d I replied.\n\u201cDon\u2019t alarm him more than necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I told him to beware,\u201d said my companion; \u201cand he must bide the\nconsequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn\u2019t he been intimate with Mr.\nHeathcliff lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,\u201d answered I, \u201cthough more\non the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than\nbecause the master likes his company. At present he\u2019s discharged from\nthe trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after\nMiss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he\u2019ll be taken in\nagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?\u201d was the doctor\u2019s\nnext question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in her confidence,\u201d returned I, reluctant to continue the\nsubject.\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s a sly one,\u201d he remarked, shaking his head. \u201cShe keeps her\nown counsel! But she\u2019s a real little fool. I have it from good\nauthority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and\nHeathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house\nabove two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount\nhis horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him\noff by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first\nmeeting after that: when it was to be he didn\u2019t hear; but you urge Mr.\nLinton to look sharp!\u201d\n\nThis news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran\nmost of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I\nspared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the\nhouse door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have\nescaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On\nascending to Isabella\u2019s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was\nempty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton\u2019s illness might have\narrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare\npossibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not\npursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the\nplace with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,\nabsorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to\nspare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,\nand suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I\nwent with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay\nin a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess\nof frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every\nchange of her painfully expressive features.\n\nThe doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him\nof its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve\naround her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the\nthreatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of\nintellect.\n\nI did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we\nnever went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual\nhour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging\nwhispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one\nwas active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she\nslept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient\nfor her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her\nsister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was\nspared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of\nthe maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to\nGimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the\nchamber, crying: \u201cOh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master,\nmaster, our young lady\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your noise!\u201d cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.\n\n\u201cSpeak lower, Mary\u2014What is the matter?\u201d said Mr. Linton. \u201cWhat ails\nyour young lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone! Yon\u2019 Heathcliff\u2019s run off wi\u2019 her!\u201d gasped the\ngirl.\n\n\u201cThat is not true!\u201d exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. \u201cIt cannot\nbe: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It\nis incredible: it cannot be.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his\ndemand to know her reasons for such an assertion.\n\n\u201cWhy, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,\u201d she stammered,\n\u201cand he asked whether we weren\u2019t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he\nmeant for missis\u2019s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, \u2018There\u2019s\nsomebody gone after \u2019em, I guess?\u2019 I stared. He saw I knew nought about\nit, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse\u2019s\nshoe fastened at a blacksmith\u2019s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not\nvery long after midnight! and how the blacksmith\u2019s lass had got up to\nspy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the\nman\u2014Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob\u2019dy could mistake him,\nbesides\u2014put a sovereign in her father\u2019s hand for payment. The lady had\na cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she\ndrank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both\nbridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and\nwent as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing\nto her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.\u201d\n\nI ran and peeped, for form\u2019s sake, into Isabella\u2019s room; confirming,\nwhen I returned, the servant\u2019s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his\nseat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the\nmeaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,\nor uttering a word.\n\n\u201cAre we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,\u201d I\ninquired. \u201cHow should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe went of her own accord,\u201d answered the master; \u201cshe had a right to\ngo if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only\nmy sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has\ndisowned me.\u201d\n\nAnd that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry\nfurther, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what\nproperty she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when\nI knew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nFor two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\nLinton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was\ndenominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child\nmore devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching,\nand patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a\nshaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he\nsaved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the\nsource of constant future anxiety\u2014in fact, that his health and strength\nwere being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity\u2014he knew no\nlimits in gratitude and joy when Catherine\u2019s life was declared out of\ndanger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the\ngradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes\nwith the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance\nalso, and she would soon be entirely her former self.\n\nThe first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\nfollowing March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\nhandful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\npleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered\nthem eagerly together.\n\n\u201cThese are the earliest flowers at the Heights,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cThey\nremind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted\nsnow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost\ngone?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe snow is quite gone down here, darling,\u201d replied her husband; \u201cand\nI only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is\nblue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim\nfull. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you\nunder this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the\nair blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall never be there but once more,\u201d said the invalid; \u201cand then\nyou\u2019ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you\u2019ll long\nagain to have me under this roof, and you\u2019ll look back and think you\nwere happy to-day.\u201d\n\nLinton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\nthe fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the\ntears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We\nknew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long\nconfinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it\nmight be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to\nlight a fire in the many-weeks\u2019 deserted parlour, and to set an\neasy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,\nand she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,\nrevived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free\nfrom the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By\nevening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade\nher to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa\nfor her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the\nfatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where\nyou lie at present\u2014on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon\nstrong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar\u2019s arm.\nAh, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And\nthere was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that\nof another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton\u2019s\nheart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger\u2019s\ngripe, by the birth of an heir.\n\nI should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\nher departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.\nIt appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil\nan obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and\nreconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she\ncould not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal\nit. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,\nI got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a\nbride just out of the honeymoon. I\u2019ll read it: for I keep it yet. Any\nrelic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nDEAR ELLEN, it begins,\u2014I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\nheard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very\nill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too\nangry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write\nto somebody, and the only choice left me is you.\n\nInform Edgar that I\u2019d give the world to see his face again\u2014that my\nheart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left\nit, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and\nCatherine! _I can\u2019t follow it though_\u2014(these words are underlined)\u2014they\nneed not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please;\ntaking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or\ndeficient affection.\n\nThe remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you\ntwo questions: the first is,\u2014How did you contrive to preserve the\ncommon sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot\nrecognise any sentiment which those around share with me.\n\nThe second question I have great interest in; it is this\u2014Is Mr.\nHeathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I\nsha\u2019n\u2019t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\nexplain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\nme; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don\u2019t write, but come, and\nbring me something from Edgar.\n\nNow, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am\nled to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell\non such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\nthoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and\ndance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,\nand the rest was an unnatural dream!\n\nThe sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\njudged it to be six o\u2019clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\ninspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\nwell as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard\nof the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\nreceive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that\nredounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a\nlevel with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\naway. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\nreappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived\nin an ancient castle.\n\nHeathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen\u2014a dingy,\nuntidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\nwas in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\nand dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\nmouth.\n\n\u201cThis is Edgar\u2019s legal nephew,\u201d I reflected\u2014\u201cmine in a manner; I must\nshake hands, and\u2014yes\u2014I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good\nunderstanding at the beginning.\u201d\n\nI approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said\u2014\u201cHow do you\ndo, my dear?\u201d\n\nHe replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.\n\n\u201cShall you and I be friends, Hareton?\u201d was my next essay at\nconversation.\n\nAn oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not \u201cframe off\u201d\nrewarded my perseverance.\n\n\u201cHey, Throttler, lad!\u201d whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred\nbull-dog from its lair in a corner. \u201cNow, wilt thou be ganging?\u201d he\nasked authoritatively.\n\nLove for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to\nwait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;\nand Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany\nme in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\nreplied\u2014\u201cMim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?\nMincing un\u2019 munching! How can I tell whet ye say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, I wish you to come with me into the house!\u201d I cried, thinking\nhim deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.\n\n\u201cNone o\u2019 me! I getten summut else to do,\u201d he answered, and continued\nhis work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\ncountenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I\u2019m\nsure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.\n\nI walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at\nwhich I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant\nmight show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,\ngaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his\nfeatures were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;\nand _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine\u2019s with all their\nbeauty annihilated.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your business here?\u201d he demanded, grimly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name _was_ Isabella Linton,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me before,\nsir. I\u2019m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here\u2014I\nsuppose by your permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he come back, then?\u201d asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014we came just now,\u201d I said; \u201cbut he left me by the kitchen door;\nand when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\nplace, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well the hellish villain has kept his word!\u201d growled my future\nhost, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\nHeathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\nthreats of what he would have done had the \u201cfiend\u201d deceived him.\n\nI repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined\nto slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\nintention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There\nwas a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,\nwhose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant\npewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook\nof a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether\nI might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw\nvouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his\npockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction\nwas evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I\nshrank from disturbing him again.\n\nYou\u2019ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\nseated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\nremembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\nthe only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\nAtlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\nthem! I questioned with myself\u2014where must I turn for comfort? and\u2014mind\nyou don\u2019t tell Edgar, or Catherine\u2014above every sorrow beside, this rose\npre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\nagainst Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\ngladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone\nwith him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not\nfear their intermeddling.\n\nI sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\nstill my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\nperfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\nout at intervals. I listened to detect a woman\u2019s voice in the house,\nand filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,\nwhich, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I\nwas not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in\nhis measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.\nTaking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed\u2014\u201cI\u2019m tired\nwith my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?\nDirect me to her, as she won\u2019t come to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have none,\u201d he answered; \u201cyou must wait on yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere must I sleep, then?\u201d I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\nself-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.\n\n\u201cJoseph will show you Heathcliff\u2019s chamber,\u201d said he; \u201copen that\ndoor\u2014he\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nI was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\nstrangest tone\u2014\u201cBe so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\nbolt\u2014don\u2019t omit it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d I said. \u201cBut why, Mr. Earnshaw?\u201d I did not relish the notion of\ndeliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cLook here!\u201d he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\ncuriously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife\nattached to the barrel. \u201cThat\u2019s a great tempter to a desperate man, is\nit not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his\ndoor. If once I find it open he\u2019s done for; I do it invariably, even\nthough the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that\nshould make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own\nschemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long\nas you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall\nsave him!\u201d\n\nI surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how\npowerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his\nhand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my\nface assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\ncovetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\nand returned it to its concealment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you tell him,\u201d said he. \u201cPut him on his guard, and\nwatch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\nshock you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has Heathcliff done to you?\u201d I asked. \u201cIn what has he wronged\nyou, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn\u2019t it be wiser to bid him\nquit the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d thundered Earnshaw; \u201cshould he offer to leave me, he\u2019s a dead\nman: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose\n_all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,\ndamnation! I _will_ have it back; and I\u2019ll have _his_ gold too; and\nthen his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times\nblacker with that guest than ever it was before!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master\u2019s habits. He is\nclearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I\nshuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant\u2019s ill-bred\nmoroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody\nwalk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was\nbending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;\nand a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents\nof the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the\nbowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,\nand, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out\nsharply, \u201c_I\u2019ll_ make the porridge!\u201d I removed the vessel out of his\nreach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. \u201cMr.\nEarnshaw,\u201d I continued, \u201cdirects me to wait on myself: I will. I\u2019m not\ngoing to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.\u201d\n\n\u201cGooid Lord!\u201d he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\nstockings from the knee to the ankle. \u201cIf there\u2019s to be fresh\northerings\u2014just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev\u2019 a\n_mistress_ set o\u2019er my heead, it\u2019s like time to be flitting. I niver\n_did_ think to see t\u2019 day that I mud lave th\u2019 owld place\u2014but I doubt\nit\u2019s nigh at hand!\u201d\n\nThis lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,\nsighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but\ncompelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall\npast happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its\napparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the\nhandfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery\nwith growing indignation.\n\n\u201cThear!\u201d he ejaculated. \u201cHareton, thou willn\u2019t sup thy porridge\nto-neeght; they\u2019ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear,\nagean! I\u2019d fling in bowl un\u2019 all, if I wer ye! There, pale t\u2019 guilp\noff, un\u2019 then ye\u2019ll hae done wi\u2019t. Bang, bang. It\u2019s a mercy t\u2019 bothom\nisn\u2019t deaved out!\u201d\n\nIt _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\nhad been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from\nthe dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling\nfrom the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have\nhis in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so\ndirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;\nassuring me, repeatedly, that \u201cthe barn was every bit as good\u201d as I,\n\u201cand every bit as wollsome,\u201d and wondering how I could fashion to be so\nconceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and\nglowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.\n\n\u201cI shall have my supper in another room,\u201d I said. \u201cHave you no place\nyou call a parlour?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Parlour_!\u201d he echoed, sneeringly, \u201c_parlour_! Nay, we\u2019ve noa\n_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there\u2019s maister\u2019s; un\u2019 if\nyah dunnut loike maister, there\u2019s us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall go upstairs,\u201d I answered; \u201cshow me a chamber.\u201d\n\nI put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With\ngreat grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\nmounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into\nthe apartments we passed.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a rahm,\u201d he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\nhinges. \u201cIt\u2019s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There\u2019s a pack o\u2019\ncorn i\u2019 t\u2019 corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye\u2019re feared o\u2019 muckying\nyer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o\u2019 t\u2019 top on\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crahm\u201d was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\nvarious sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\nspace in the middle.\n\n\u201cWhy, man,\u201d I exclaimed, facing him angrily, \u201cthis is not a place to\nsleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Bed-rume_!\u201d he repeated, in a tone of mockery. \u201cYah\u2019s see all t\u2019\n_bed-rumes_ thear is\u2014yon\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nHe pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in\nbeing more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless\nbed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.\n\n\u201cWhat do I want with yours?\u201d I retorted. \u201cI suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\nnot lodge at the top of the house, does he?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! it\u2019s Maister _Hathecliff\u2019s_ ye\u2019re wanting?\u201d cried he, as if making\na new discovery. \u201cCouldn\u2019t ye ha\u2019 said soa, at onst? un\u2019 then, I mud\nha\u2019 telled ye, baht all this wark, that that\u2019s just one ye cannut\nsee\u2014he allas keeps it locked, un\u2019 nob\u2019dy iver mells on\u2019t but hisseln.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve a nice house, Joseph,\u201d I could not refrain from observing, \u201cand\npleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the\nmadness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my\nfate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose\u2014there are\nother rooms. For heaven\u2019s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!\u201d\n\nHe made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\nwooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt\nand the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best\none. There was a carpet\u2014a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by\ndust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\noak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material\nand modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\nvallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\nsupporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\ntrail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them\nseverely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was\nendeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\nwhen my fool of a guide announced,\u2014\u201cThis here is t\u2019 maister\u2019s.\u201d My\nsupper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\nexhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\nrefuge, and means of repose.\n\n\u201cWhear the divil?\u201d began the religious elder. \u201cThe Lord bless us! The\nLord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome\nnowt! Ye\u2019ve seen all but Hareton\u2019s bit of a cham\u2019er. There\u2019s not\nanother hoile to lig down in i\u2019 th\u2019 hahse!\u201d\n\nI was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and\nthen seated myself at the stairs\u2019-head, hid my face in my hands, and\ncried.\n\n\u201cEch! ech!\u201d exclaimed Joseph. \u201cWeel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss\nCathy! Howsiver, t\u2019 maister sall just tum\u2019le o\u2019er them brocken pots;\nun\u2019 then we\u2019s hear summut; we\u2019s hear how it\u2019s to be. Gooid-for-naught\nmadling! ye desarve pining fro\u2019 this to Churstmas, flinging t\u2019 precious\ngifts uh God under fooit i\u2019 yer flaysome rages! But I\u2019m mista\u2019en if ye\nshew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?\nI nobbut wish he may catch ye i\u2019 that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.\u201d\n\nAnd so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with\nhim; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding\nthis silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\npride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its\neffects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of\nThrottler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had\nspent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.\nHindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of\nsalute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from\nstep to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the\nspatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our\nlabours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw\u2019s tread in the\npassage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I\nstole into the nearest doorway. The dog\u2019s endeavour to avoid him was\nunsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,\npiteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,\nand shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put\nhim to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton\u2019s room, and the old man, on\nseeing me, said,\u2014\u201cThey\u2019s rahm for boath ye un\u2019 yer pride, now, I sud\nthink i\u2019 the hahse. It\u2019s empty; ye may hev\u2019 it all to yerseln, un\u2019 Him\nas allas maks a third, i\u2019 sich ill company!\u201d\n\nGladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\nmyself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was\ndeep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\nhad just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\nthere? I told him the cause of my staying up so late\u2014that he had the\nkey of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.\nHe swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he\u2019d\u2014but I\u2019ll not\nrepeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\nand unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at\nhim with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger\nor a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which\nhe wakens. He told me of Catherine\u2019s illness, and accused my brother of\ncausing it; promising that I should be Edgar\u2019s proxy in suffering, till\nhe could get hold of him.\n\nI do hate him\u2014I am wretched\u2014I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one\nbreath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every\nday\u2014don\u2019t disappoint me!\u2014ISABELLA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nAs soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and\ninformed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a\nletter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton\u2019s situation, and her\nardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as\nearly as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.\n\n\u201cForgiveness!\u201d said Linton. \u201cI have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You\nmay call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that\nI am not _angry_, but I\u2019m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can\nnever think she\u2019ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see\nher, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to\noblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the\ncountry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t write her a little note, sir?\u201d I asked, imploringly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is needless. My communication with Heathcliff\u2019s\nfamily shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!\u201d\n\nMr. Edgar\u2019s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\nGrange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,\nwhen I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines\nto console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\nmorning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\ncauseway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\nobserved. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,\ndismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,\nthat if I had been in the young lady\u2019s place, I would, at least, have\nswept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already\npartook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her\npretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\nlankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she\nhad not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.\nMr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\npocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\nfriendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that\nseemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had\ncircumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\nstruck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\nthorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and\nheld out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She\nwouldn\u2019t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I\nwent to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her\ndirectly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her\nman\u0153uvres, and said\u2014\u201cIf you have got anything for Isabella (as no\ndoubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn\u2019t make a secret of\nit: we have no secrets between us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I have nothing,\u201d I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\nonce. \u201cMy master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\na letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma\u2019am, and\nhis wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\noccasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\nhousehold here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\nkeeping it up.\u201d\n\nMrs. Heathcliff\u2019s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat\nin the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,\nand began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as\nI thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\ncross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I\nblamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended\nby hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton\u2019s example and avoid future\ninterference with his family, for good or evil.\n\n\u201cMrs. Linton is now just recovering,\u201d I said; \u201cshe\u2019ll never be like she\nwas, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\nyou\u2019ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you\u2019ll move out of this\ncountry entirely; and that you may not regret it, I\u2019ll inform you\nCatherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine\nEarnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is\nchanged greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is\ncompelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his\naffection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common\nhumanity, and a sense of duty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite possible,\u201d remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\ncalm: \u201cquite possible that your master should have nothing but common\nhumanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that\nI shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you\ncompare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this\nhouse, I must exact a promise from you that you\u2019ll get me an interview\nwith her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d I replied, \u201cyou must not: you never shall,\nthrough my means. Another encounter between you and the master would\nkill her altogether.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith your aid that may be avoided,\u201d he continued; \u201cand should there be\ndanger of such an event\u2014should he be the cause of adding a single\ntrouble more to her existence\u2014why, I think I shall be justified in\ngoing to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\nCatherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\nrestrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\nhad he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\nthat turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\nhim. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have\nbanished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment\nher regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his\nblood! But, till then\u2014if you don\u2019t believe me, you don\u2019t know me\u2014till\nthen, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his\nhead!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cyou have no scruples in completely ruining\nall hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\nremembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her\nin a new tumult of discord and distress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou suppose she has nearly forgotten me?\u201d he said. \u201cOh, Nelly! you\nknow she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she\nspends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable\nperiod of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my\nreturn to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance\ncould make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be\nnothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words\nwould comprehend my future\u2014_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing\nher, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she\nvalued Edgar Linton\u2019s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all\nthe powers of his puny being, he couldn\u2019t love as much in eighty years\nas I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the\nsea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole\naffection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer\nto her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like\nme: how can she love in him what he has not?\u201d\n\n\u201cCatherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can\nbe,\u201d cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. \u201cNo one has a right to talk\nin that manner, and I won\u2019t hear my brother depreciated in silence!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn\u2019t he?\u201d observed\nHeathcliff, scornfully. \u201cHe turns you adrift on the world with\nsurprising alacrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not aware of what I suffer,\u201d she replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him\nthat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been telling him something, then: you have written, have\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that I was married, I did write\u2014you saw the note.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd nothing since?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,\u201d\nI remarked. \u201cSomebody\u2019s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,\nI may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should guess it was her own,\u201d said Heathcliff. \u201cShe degenerates into\na mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.\nYou\u2019d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was\nweeping to go home. However, she\u2019ll suit this house so much the better\nfor not being over nice, and I\u2019ll take care she does not disgrace me by\nrambling abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d returned I, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff\nis accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\nbrought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.\nYou must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you\nmust treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot\ndoubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn\u2019t\nhave abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former\nhome, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe abandoned them under a delusion,\u201d he answered; \u201cpicturing in me a\nhero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\ndevotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\nso obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\ncharacter and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at\nlast, I think she begins to know me: I don\u2019t perceive the silly smiles\nand grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability\nof discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\ninfatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\ndiscover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons\ncould teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\nannounced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\nsucceeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I\nassure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I\ntrust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you\nalone for half a day, won\u2019t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?\nI daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it\nwounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don\u2019t care who knows\nthat the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie\nabout it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful\nsoftness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,\nwas to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first\nwords I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being\nbelonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for\nherself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate\nadmiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!\nNow, was it not the depth of absurdity\u2014of genuine idiocy, for that\npitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?\nTell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an\nabject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I\u2019ve\nsometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on\nwhat she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But\ntell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:\nthat I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up\nto this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;\nand, what\u2019s more, she\u2019d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to\ngo, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification\nto be derived from tormenting her!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Heathcliff,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is the talk of a madman; your wife,\nmost likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has\nborne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she\u2019ll\ndoubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched,\nma\u2019am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake care, Ellen!\u201d answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;\nthere was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her\npartner\u2019s endeavours to make himself detested. \u201cDon\u2019t put faith in a\nsingle word he speaks. He\u2019s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human\nbeing! I\u2019ve been told I might leave him before; and I\u2019ve made the\nattempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you\u2019ll not\nmention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or\nCatherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to\ndesperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over\nhim; and he sha\u2019n\u2019t obtain it\u2014I\u2019ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that\nhe may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure\nI can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2014that will do for the present!\u201d said Heathcliff. \u201cIf you are\ncalled upon in a court of law, you\u2019ll remember her language, Nelly! And\ntake a good look at that countenance: she\u2019s near the point which would\nsuit me. No; you\u2019re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\nI, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\ndistasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say\nto Ellen Dean in private. That\u2019s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!\nWhy, this is the road upstairs, child!\u201d\n\nHe seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering\u2014\u201cI have\nno pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\ncrush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with\ngreater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you understand what the word pity means?\u201d I said, hastening to\nresume my bonnet. \u201cDid you ever feel a touch of it in your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that down!\u201d he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.\n\u201cYou are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\ncompel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,\nand that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don\u2019t desire\nto cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only\nwish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to\nask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I\nwas in the Grange garden six hours, and I\u2019ll return there to-night; and\nevery night I\u2019ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an\nopportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate\nto knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I\nstay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these\npistols. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with\nthem, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I\u2019d warn you when\nI came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was\nalone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would\nbe hindering mischief.\u201d\n\nI protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer\u2019s\nhouse: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his\ndestroying Mrs. Linton\u2019s tranquillity for his satisfaction. \u201cThe\ncommonest occurrence startles her painfully,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s all\nnerves, and she couldn\u2019t bear the surprise, I\u2019m positive. Don\u2019t\npersist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your\ndesigns; and he\u2019ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates\nfrom any such unwarrantable intrusions!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case I\u2019ll take measures to secure you, woman!\u201d exclaimed\nHeathcliff; \u201cyou shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow\nmorning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear\nto see me; and as to surprising her, I don\u2019t desire it: you must\nprepare her\u2014ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name,\nand that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if\nI am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for\nher husband. Oh, I\u2019ve no doubt she\u2019s in hell among you! I guess by her\nsilence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often\nrestless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You\ntalk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise\nin her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending\nher from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He might as\nwell plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine\nhe can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares! Let us\nsettle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to\nCatherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you\nhave been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no\nreason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn\nill-nature!\u201d\n\nWell, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him\nfifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I\nengaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she\nconsent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton\u2019s next\nabsence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I\nwouldn\u2019t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the\nway. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I\nthought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought,\ntoo, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine\u2019s mental illness:\nand then I remembered Mr. Edgar\u2019s stern rebuke of my carrying tales;\nand I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by\naffirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it\nmerited so harsh an appellation, should be the last. Notwithstanding,\nmy journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many\nmisgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into\nMrs. Linton\u2019s hand.\n\nBut here is Kenneth; I\u2019ll go down, and tell him how much better you\nare. My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away\nanother morning.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nDree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive\nthe doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to\namuse me. But never mind! I\u2019ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs.\nDean\u2019s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that\nlurks in Catherine Heathcliff\u2019s brilliant eyes. I should be in a\ncurious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the\ndaughter turned out a second edition of the mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nAnother week over\u2014and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I\nhave now heard all my neighbour\u2019s history, at different sittings, as\nthe housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I\u2019ll\ncontinue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the\nwhole, a very fair narrator, and I don\u2019t think I could improve her\nstyle.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nIn the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I\nknew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place;\nand I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my\npocket, and didn\u2019t want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made\nup my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not\nguess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that\nit did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was\nSunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to\nchurch. There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we\ngenerally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of\nservice; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that\nI set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would\nbe coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for\nsome oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be\npaid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went upstairs.\n\nMrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her\nshoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long\nhair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now\nshe wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and\nneck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when\nshe was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of\nher eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they\nno longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her:\nthey appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond\u2014you would have said\nout of this world. Then, the paleness of her face\u2014its haggard aspect\nhaving vanished as she recovered flesh\u2014and the peculiar expression\narising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their\ncauses, added to the touching interest which she awakened;\nand\u2014invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should\nthink\u2014refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as\none doomed to decay.\n\nA book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible\nwind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it\nthere: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or\noccupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to\nentice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her\namusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods\nendured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and\nthen suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the\nsaddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly\naway, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and\nthen he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no\ngood.\n\nGimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of\nthe beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet\nsubstitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which\ndrowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At\nWuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great\nthaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was\nthinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all;\nbut she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed\nno recognition of material things either by ear or eye.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,\u201d I said, gently inserting it in\none hand that rested on her knee. \u201cYou must read it immediately,\nbecause it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she\nanswered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it\u2014it\nwas very short. \u201cNow,\u201d I continued, \u201cread it.\u201d She drew away her hand,\nand let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it\nshould please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed\nthat at last I resumed\u2014\u201cMust I read it, ma\u2019am? It is from Mr.\nHeathcliff.\u201d\n\nThere was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle\nto arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it;\nand when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she\nhad not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply,\nshe merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and\nquestioning eagerness.\n\n\u201cWell, he wishes to see you,\u201d said I, guessing her need of an\ninterpreter. \u201cHe\u2019s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know\nwhat answer I shall bring.\u201d\n\nAs I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath\nraise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back,\nannounce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did\nnot consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened\nbreathlessly. The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open\nhouse was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely\nhe supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to\ntrust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed\ntowards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room\ndirectly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could\nreach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her\ngrasped in his arms.\n\nHe neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during\nwhich period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life\nbefore, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I\nplainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look\ninto her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the\ninstant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery\nthere\u2014she was fated, sure to die.\n\n\u201cOh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?\u201d was the first sentence he\nuttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now\nhe stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his\ngaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:\nthey did not melt.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\nsuddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly\nvarying caprices. \u201cYou and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And\nyou both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be\npitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me\u2014and thriven on\nit, I think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live\nafter I am gone?\u201d\n\nHeathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,\nbut she seized his hair, and kept him down.\n\n\u201cI wish I could hold you,\u201d she continued, bitterly, \u201ctill we were both\ndead! I shouldn\u2019t care what you suffered. I care nothing for your\nsufferings. Why shouldn\u2019t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will\nyou be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence,\n\u2018That\u2019s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was\nwretched to lose her; but it is past. I\u2019ve loved many others since: my\nchildren are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not\nrejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave\nthem!\u2019 Will you say so, Heathcliff?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t torture me till I\u2019m as mad as yourself,\u201d cried he, wrenching his\nhead free, and grinding his teeth.\n\nThe two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well\nmight Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,\nunless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her\npresent countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a\nbloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed\nfingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her\ncompanion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm\nwith the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the\nrequirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four\ndistinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.\n\n\u201cAre you possessed with a devil,\u201d he pursued, savagely, \u201cto talk in\nthat manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those\nwords will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after\nyou have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,\nCatherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is\nit not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at\npeace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall not be at peace,\u201d moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\nphysical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\nbeat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said\nnothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\nkindly\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only\nwish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\nhereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\nsake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me\nin your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\nthan my harsh words! Won\u2019t you come here again? Do!\u201d\n\nHeathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so\nfar as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent\nround to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he\nwalked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards\nus. Mrs. Linton\u2019s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke\na new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she\nresumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:\u2014\n\n\u201cOh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\ngrave. _That_ is how I\u2019m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_\nHeathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he\u2019s in my\nsoul. And,\u201d added she musingly, \u201cthe thing that irks me most is this\nshattered prison, after all. I\u2019m tired of being enclosed here. I\u2019m\nwearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:\nnot seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the\nwalls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you\nthink you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and\nstrength: you are sorry for me\u2014very soon that will be altered. I shall\nbe sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I\n_wonder_ he won\u2019t be near me!\u201d She went on to herself. \u201cI thought he\nwished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to\nme, Heathcliff.\u201d\n\nIn her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the\nchair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely\ndesperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his\nbreast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how\nthey met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,\nand they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress\nwould never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly\ninsensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my\napproaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at\nme, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy\njealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of\nmy own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I\nspoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.\n\nA movement of Catherine\u2019s relieved me a little presently: she put up\nher hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;\nwhile he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly\u2014\n\n\u201cYou teach me now how cruel you\u2019ve been\u2014cruel and false. _Why_ did you\ndespise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one\nword of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you\nmay kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they\u2019ll blight\nyou\u2014they\u2019ll damn you. You loved me\u2014then what _right_ had you to leave\nme? What right\u2014answer me\u2014for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?\nBecause misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or\nSatan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did\nit. I have not broken your heart\u2014_you_ have broken it; and in breaking\nit, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do\nI want to live? What kind of living will it be when you\u2014oh, God! would\n_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me alone. Let me alone,\u201d sobbed Catherine. \u201cIf I\u2019ve done wrong,\nI\u2019m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won\u2019t upbraid\nyou! I forgive you. Forgive me!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those\nwasted hands,\u201d he answered. \u201cKiss me again; and don\u2019t let me see your\neyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer\u2014but\n_yours_! How can I?\u201d\n\nThey were silent\u2014their faces hid against each other, and washed by each\nother\u2019s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it\nseemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.\n\nI grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,\nthe man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could\ndistinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse\nthickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.\n\n\u201cService is over,\u201d I announced. \u201cMy master will be here in half an\nhour.\u201d\n\nHeathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never\nmoved.\n\nEre long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road\ntowards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the\ngate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely\nafternoon that breathed as soft as summer.\n\n\u201cNow he is here,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, hurry down! You\u2019ll\nnot meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the\ntrees till he is fairly in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must go, Cathy,\u201d said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from\nhis companion\u2019s arms. \u201cBut if I live, I\u2019ll see you again before you are\nasleep. I won\u2019t stray five yards from your window.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must not go!\u201d she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength\nallowed. \u201cYou _shall_ not, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one hour,\u201d he pleaded earnestly.\n\n\u201cNot for one minute,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cI _must_\u2014Linton will be up immediately,\u201d persisted the alarmed\nintruder.\n\nHe would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act\u2014she clung fast,\ngasping: there was mad resolution in her face.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cOh, don\u2019t, don\u2019t go. It is the last time! Edgar\nwill not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn the fool! There he is,\u201d cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his\nseat. \u201cHush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I\u2019ll stay. If he shot\nme so, I\u2019d expire with a blessing on my lips.\u201d\n\nAnd there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the\nstairs\u2014the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.\n\n\u201cAre you going to listen to her ravings?\u201d I said, passionately. \u201cShe\ndoes not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit\nto help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most\ndiabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for\u2014master,\nmistress, and servant.\u201d\n\nI wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at\nthe noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to\nobserve that Catherine\u2019s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung\ndown.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fainted, or dead,\u201d I thought: \u201cso much the better. Far better\nthat she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to\nall about her.\u201d\n\nEdgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and\nrage. What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all\ndemonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his\narms.\n\n\u201cLook there!\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you be a fiend, help her first\u2014then you\nshall speak to me!\u201d\n\nHe walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and\nwith great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to\nrestore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and\nmoaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her\nhated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and\nbesought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he\nshould hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.\n\n\u201cI shall not refuse to go out of doors,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut I shall stay\nin the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall\nbe under those larch-trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether\nLinton be in or not.\u201d\n\nHe sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,\nascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the\nhouse of his luckless presence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAbout twelve o\u2019clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at\nWuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months\u2019 child; and two hours after the\nmother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss\nHeathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter\u2019s distraction at his bereavement\nis a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how\ndeep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left\nwithout an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and\nI mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the\nsecuring his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son\u2019s. An\nunwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,\nand nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We\nredeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as\nits end is likely to be.\n\nNext morning\u2014bright and cheerful out of doors\u2014stole softened in through\nthe blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant\nwith a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the\npillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as\ndeathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but\n_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.\nHer brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a\nsmile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.\nAnd I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never\nin a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine\nrest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours\nbefore: \u201cIncomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth\nor now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise\nthan happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied\nor despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that\nneither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the\nendless and shadowless hereafter\u2014the Eternity they have entered\u2014where\nlife is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in\nits fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is\neven in a love like Mr. Linton\u2019s, when he so regretted Catherine\u2019s\nblessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward\nand impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of\npeace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not\nthen, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity,\nwhich seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.\n\nDo you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir? I\u2019d\ngive a great deal to know.\n\nI declined answering Mrs. Dean\u2019s question, which struck me as something\nheterodox. She proceeded:\n\nRetracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to\nthink she is; but we\u2019ll leave her with her Maker.\n\nThe master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the\nroom and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me\ngone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my\nchief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the\nlarches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the\nGrange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger\ngoing to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware,\nfrom the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of\nthe outer doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared,\nto find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get\nit over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there\u2014at least, a\nfew yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat\noff, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded\nbranches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long\ntime in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing\nscarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and\nregarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They\nflew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:\u2014\u201cShe\u2019s\ndead!\u201d he said; \u201cI\u2019ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your\nhandkerchief away\u2014don\u2019t snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none\nof _your_ tears!\u201d\n\nI was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures\nthat have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I\nfirst looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of\nthe catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was\nquelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on\nthe ground.\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s dead!\u201d I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.\n\u201cGone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take\ndue warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid _she_ take due warning, then?\u201d asked Heathcliff, attempting a\nsneer. \u201cDid she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the\nevent. How did\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and\ncompressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,\ndefying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.\n\u201cHow did she die?\u201d he resumed, at last\u2014fain, notwithstanding his\nhardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he\ntrembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.\n\n\u201cPoor wretch!\u201d I thought; \u201cyou have a heart and nerves the same as your\nbrother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride\ncannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of\nhumiliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuietly as a lamb!\u201d I answered, aloud. \u201cShe drew a sigh, and stretched\nherself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five\nminutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2014did she ever mention me?\u201d he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded\nthe answer to his question would introduce details that he could not\nbear to hear.\n\n\u201cHer senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you\nleft her,\u201d I said. \u201cShe lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her\nlatest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a\ngentle dream\u2014may she wake as kindly in the other world!\u201d\n\n\u201cMay she wake in torment!\u201d he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping\nhis foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.\n\u201cWhy, she\u2019s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_\u2014not in\nheaven\u2014not perished\u2014where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my\nsufferings! And I pray one prayer\u2014I repeat it till my tongue\nstiffens\u2014Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;\nyou said I killed you\u2014haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their\nmurderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be\nwith me always\u2014take any form\u2014drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in\nthis abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I\n_cannot_ live without my life! I _cannot_ live without my soul!\u201d\n\nHe dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,\nhowled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death\nwith knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the\nbark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably\nthe scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the\nnight. It hardly moved my compassion\u2014it appalled me: still, I felt\nreluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough\nto notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I\nobeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!\n\nMrs. Linton\u2019s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday\nfollowing her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and\nstrewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.\nLinton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and\u2014a\ncircumstance concealed from all but me\u2014Heathcliff spent his nights, at\nleast, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication\nwith him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;\nand on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer\nfatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and\nopened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a\nchance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. He\ndid not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and\nbriefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.\nIndeed, I shouldn\u2019t have discovered that he had been there, except for\nthe disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse\u2019s face, and for\nobserving on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver\nthread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a\nlocket hung round Catherine\u2019s neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket\nand cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I\ntwisted the two, and enclosed them together.\n\nMr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his\nsister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that,\nbesides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and\nservants. Isabella was not asked.\n\nThe place of Catherine\u2019s interment, to the surprise of the villagers,\nwas neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor\nyet by the tombs of her own relations, outside. It was dug on a green\nslope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath\nand bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould\nalmost buries it. Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have\neach a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to\nmark the graves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThat Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening\nthe weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and\nbrought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could\nhardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses\nand crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent,\nthe young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary,\nand chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his\nroom; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a\nnursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid\non my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still\ndriving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened,\nand some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was\ngreater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the\nmaids, and I cried\u2014\u201cHave done! How dare you show your giddiness here?\nWhat would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d answered a familiar voice; \u201cbut I know Edgar is in bed,\nand I cannot stop myself.\u201d\n\nWith that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her\nhand to her side.\n\n\u201cI have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!\u201d she continued, after\na pause; \u201cexcept where I\u2019ve flown. I couldn\u2019t count the number of falls\nI\u2019ve had. Oh, I\u2019m aching all over! Don\u2019t be alarmed! There shall be an\nexplanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to\nstep out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a\nservant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.\u201d\n\nThe intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing\npredicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and\nwater; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore,\nbefitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short\nsleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light\nsilk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by\nthin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the\ncold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and\nbruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and\nyou may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had\nleisure to examine her.\n\n\u201cMy dear young lady,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ll stir nowhere, and hear\nnothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put\non dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so\nit is needless to order the carriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly I shall,\u201d she said; \u201cwalking or riding: yet I\u2019ve no\nobjection to dress myself decently. And\u2014ah, see how it flows down my\nneck now! The fire does make it smart.\u201d\n\nShe insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me\ntouch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get\nready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain\nher consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.\n\n\u201cNow, Ellen,\u201d she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in\nan easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, \u201cyou sit\ndown opposite me, and put poor Catherine\u2019s baby away: I don\u2019t like to\nsee it! You mustn\u2019t think I care little for Catherine, because I\nbehaved so foolishly on entering: I\u2019ve cried, too, bitterly\u2014yes, more\nthan any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you\nremember, and I sha\u2019n\u2019t forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not\ngoing to sympathise with him\u2014the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker!\nThis is the last thing of his I have about me:\u201d she slipped the gold\nring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll smash it!\u201d\nshe continued, striking it with childish spite, \u201cand then I\u2019ll burn\nit!\u201d and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.\n\u201cThere! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He\u2019d be capable\nof coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion\nshould possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind,\nhas he? And I won\u2019t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him\ninto more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though,\nif I had not learned he was out of the way, I\u2019d have halted at the\nkitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted,\nand departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed\u2014of that\nincarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It\u2019s\na pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn\u2019t have run till\nI\u2019d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t talk so fast, Miss!\u201d I interrupted; \u201cyou\u2019ll disorder the\nhandkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.\nDrink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is\nsadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!\u201d\n\n\u201cAn undeniable truth,\u201d she replied. \u201cListen to that child! It maintains\na constant wail\u2014send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha\u2019n\u2019t stay\nany longer.\u201d\n\nI rang the bell, and committed it to a servant\u2019s care; and then I\ninquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an\nunlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining\nwith us.\n\n\u201cI ought, and I wished to remain,\u201d answered she, \u201cto cheer Edgar and\ntake care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my\nright home. But I tell you he wouldn\u2019t let me! Do you think he could\nbear to see me grow fat and merry\u2014could bear to think that we were\ntranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the\nsatisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its\nannoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I\nnotice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are\ninvoluntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising\nfrom his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for\nhim, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me\nfeel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing\nI contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I\u2019ve\nrecovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I\u2019d rather he\u2019d\nkill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I\u2019m at my\nease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I\ncould still be loving him, if\u2014no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the\ndevilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine\nhad an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so\nwell. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out\nof my memory!\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, hush! He\u2019s a human being,\u201d I said. \u201cBe more charitable: there\nare worse men than he is yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a human being,\u201d she retorted; \u201cand he has no claim on my\ncharity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and\nflung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he\nhas destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,\nthough he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood\nfor Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d And here Isabella began\nto cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she\nrecommenced. \u201cYou asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was\ncompelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a\npitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers\nrequires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to\nforget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous\nviolence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the\nsense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly\nbroke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a\nsignal revenge.\n\n\u201cYesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He\nkept himself sober for the purpose\u2014tolerably sober: not going to bed\nmad at six o\u2019clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he\nrose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance;\nand instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by\ntumblerfuls.\n\n\u201cHeathcliff\u2014I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house\nfrom last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his\nkin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for\nnearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his\nchamber; locking himself in\u2014as if anybody dreamt of coveting his\ncompany! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the\ndeity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed,\nwas curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding\nthese precious orisons\u2014and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse\nand his voice was strangled in his throat\u2014he would be off again; always\nstraight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a\nconstable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about\nCatherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of\ndeliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.\n\n\u201cI recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph\u2019s eternal lectures\nwithout weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot\nof a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn\u2019t think that I should\ncry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable\ncompanions. I\u2019d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than\nwith \u2018t\u2019 little maister\u2019 and his staunch supporter, that odious old\nman! When Heathcliff is in, I\u2019m often obliged to seek the kitchen and\ntheir society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he\nis not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one\ncorner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy\nhimself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter\nnow than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and\ndepressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he\u2019s sure he\u2019s an altered\nman: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved \u2018so as by\nfire.\u2019 I\u2019m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is\nnot my business.\n\n\u201cYester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on\ntowards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow\nblowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard\nand the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page\nbefore me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.\nHindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on\nthe same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below\nirrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three\nhours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which\nshook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals,\nand the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of\nthe candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was\nvery, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy\nhad vanished from the world, never to be restored.\n\n\u201cThe doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen\nlatch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;\nowing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and\nwe heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an\nirrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my\ncompanion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at\nme.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll keep him out five minutes,\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018You won\u2019t object?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Do!\nput the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.\u2019\n\n\u201cEarnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then\ncame and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over\nit, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that\ngleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he\ncouldn\u2019t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him\nto speak.\n\n\u201c\u2018You, and I,\u2019 he said, \u2018have each a great debt to settle with the man\nout yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to\ndischarge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to\nendure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m weary of enduring now,\u2019 I replied; \u2018and I\u2019d be glad of a\nretaliation that wouldn\u2019t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence\nare spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them\nworse than their enemies.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!\u2019\ncried Hindley. \u2018Mrs. Heathcliff, I\u2019ll ask you to do nothing; but sit\nstill and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I\u2019m sure you would have as\nmuch pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend\u2019s\nexistence; he\u2019ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he\u2019ll be\n_my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he\nwere master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that\nclock strikes\u2014it wants three minutes of one\u2014you\u2019re a free woman!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his\nbreast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away,\nhowever, and seized his arm.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll not hold my tongue!\u2019 I said; \u2018you mustn\u2019t touch him. Let the\ndoor remain shut, and be quiet!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No! I\u2019ve formed my resolution, and by God I\u2019ll execute it!\u2019 cried the\ndesperate being. \u2018I\u2019ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and\nHareton justice! And you needn\u2019t trouble your head to screen me;\nCatherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though\nI cut my throat this minute\u2014and it\u2019s time to make an end!\u2019\n\n\u201cI might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a\nlunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his\nintended victim of the fate which awaited him.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!\u2019 I exclaimed, in\nrather a triumphant tone. \u2018Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you\npersist in endeavouring to enter.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019d better open the door, you\u2014\u2019 he answered, addressing me by some\nelegant term that I don\u2019t care to repeat.\n\n\u201c\u2018I shall not meddle in the matter,\u2019 I retorted again. \u2018Come in and get\nshot, if you please. I\u2019ve done my duty.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire;\nhaving too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any\nanxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at\nme: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of\nnames for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and\nconscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be\nfor _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing\nfor _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing\nthese reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by\na blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked\nblightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his\nshoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His\nhair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,\nrevealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.\n\n\u201c\u2018Isabella, let me in, or I\u2019ll make you repent!\u2019 he \u2018girned,\u2019 as Joseph\ncalls it.\n\n\u201c\u2018I cannot commit murder,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with\na knife and loaded pistol.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Let me in by the kitchen door,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Hindley will be there before me,\u2019 I answered: \u2018and that\u2019s a poor love\nof yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in\nour beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of\nwinter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you,\nI\u2019d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The\nworld is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly\nimpressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life:\nI can\u2019t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s there, is he?\u2019 exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. \u2018If I\ncan get my arm out I can hit him!\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Ellen, you\u2019ll set me down as really wicked; but you don\u2019t\nknow all, so don\u2019t judge. I wouldn\u2019t have aided or abetted an attempt\non even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and\ntherefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the\nconsequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw\u2019s\nweapon and wrenched it from his grasp.\n\n\u201cThe charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its\nowner\u2019s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the\nflesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then\ntook a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang\nin. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow\nof blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian\nkicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the\nflags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning\nJoseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing\nhim completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and\ndragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore\noff the sleeve of Earnshaw\u2019s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal\nroughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically\nas he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking\nthe old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my\nhasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at\nonce.\n\n\u201c\u2018What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s this to do,\u2019 thundered Heathcliff, \u2018that your master\u2019s mad;\nand should he last another month, I\u2019ll have him to an asylum. And how\nthe devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don\u2019t\nstand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I\u2019m not going to nurse him.\nWash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle\u2014it is more\nthan half brandy!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And so ye\u2019ve been murthering on him?\u2019 exclaimed Joseph, lifting his\nhands and eyes in horror. \u2018If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the\nLord\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201cHeathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,\nand flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he\njoined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its\nodd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at\nnothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves\nat the foot of the gallows.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I forgot you,\u2019 said the tyrant. \u2018You shall do that. Down with\nyou. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? There, that\nis work fit for you!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who\nsteadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would\nset off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and\nthough he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so\nobstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to\ncompel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing\nover me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the\naccount in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour\nto satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;\nespecially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon\nconvinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a\ndose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained\nmotion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was\nignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him\ndeliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious\nconduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,\nafter giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on\nthe hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had\nescaped so easily.\n\n\u201cThis morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.\nEarnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost\nas gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared\ninclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I\ncommenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I\nexperienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at\nintervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the\ncomfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured\non the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw\u2019s\nseat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.\n\n\u201cHeathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his\nfeatures almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His\nforehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so\ndiabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were\nnearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes\nwere wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in\nan expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have\ncovered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was\ngratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I\ncouldn\u2019t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the\nonly time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cFie, fie, Miss!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cOne might suppose you had never\nopened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that\nought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your\ntorture to his!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general I\u2019ll allow that it would be, Ellen,\u201d she continued; \u201cbut\nwhat misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand\nin it? I\u2019d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings\nand he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On\nonly one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an\neye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a\nwrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him\nthe first to implore pardon; and then\u2014why then, Ellen, I might show you\nsome generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,\nand therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I\nhanded him a glass, and asked him how he was.\n\n\u201c\u2018Not as ill as I wish,\u2019 he replied. \u2018But leaving out my arm, every\ninch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, no wonder,\u2019 was my next remark. \u2018Catherine used to boast that\nshe stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons\nwould not hurt you for fear of offending her. It\u2019s well people don\u2019t\n_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have\nwitnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your\nchest and shoulders?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I can\u2019t say,\u2019 he answered; \u2018but what do you mean? Did he dare to\nstrike me when I was down?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,\u2019 I\nwhispered. \u2018And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because\nhe\u2019s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;\nwho, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:\nthe longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their\nblackness through his features.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last\nagony, I\u2019d go to hell with joy,\u2019 groaned the impatient man, writhing to\nrise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the\nstruggle.\n\n\u201c\u2018Nay, it\u2019s enough that he has murdered one of you,\u2019 I observed aloud.\n\u2018At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now\nhad it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be\nhated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were\u2014how happy\nCatherine was before he came\u2014I\u2019m fit to curse the day.\u2019\n\n\u201cMost likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than\nthe spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw,\nfor his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath\nin suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The\nclouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which\nusually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not\nfear to hazard another sound of derision.\n\n\u201c\u2018Get up, and begone out of my sight,\u2019 said the mourner.\n\n\u201cI guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was\nhardly intelligible.\n\n\u201c\u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 I replied. \u2018But I loved Catherine too; and her\nbrother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now\nthat she\u2019s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if\nyou had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and\nher\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!\u2019 he cried,\nmaking a movement that caused me to make one also.\n\n\u201c\u2018But then,\u2019 I continued, holding myself ready to flee, \u2018if poor\nCatherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,\ndegrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a\nsimilar picture! _She_ wouldn\u2019t have borne your abominable behaviour\nquietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe back of the settle and Earnshaw\u2019s person interposed between me and\nhim; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife\nfrom the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and\nstopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to\nthe door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than\nhis missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his\npart, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together\non the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to\nhis master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies\nfrom a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from\npurgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,\nquitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,\nand wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the\nbeacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a\nperpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,\nabide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.\u201d\n\nIsabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and\nbidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and\nturning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she\nstepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar\u2019s and Catherine\u2019s portraits,\nbestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,\naccompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her\nmistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but\na regular correspondence was established between her and my master when\nthings were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,\nnear London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her\nescape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him\nto be an ailing, peevish creature.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she\nlived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment,\nonly she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with\nhim, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information,\nhe discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of\nresidence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn\u2019t molest her:\nfor which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often\nasked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled\ngrimly, and observed: \u201cThey wish me to hate it too, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they wish you to know anything about it,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll have it,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I want it. They may reckon on that!\u201d\n\nFortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen\nyears after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a\nlittle more.\n\nOn the day succeeding Isabella\u2019s unexpected visit I had no opportunity\nof speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for\ndiscussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased\nhim that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an\nintensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to\nallow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from\ngoing anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief,\nand that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up\nhis office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the\nvillage on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within\nthe limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on\nthe moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or\nearly morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good\nto be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn\u2019t pray for Catherine\u2019s soul to\nhaunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than\ncommon joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and\nhopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was\ngone.\n\nAnd he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I\nsaid, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that\ncoldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could\nstammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot\u2019s sceptre in his\nheart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,\nas he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because\nHeathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it\nformed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with\nher; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than\nfrom its being his own.\n\nI used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and\nperplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so\nopposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands,\nand were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they\nshouldn\u2019t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I\nthought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has\nshown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck,\nthe captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save\nher, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless\nvessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal\nand faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,\nand the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were\nrighteously doomed to endure them. But you\u2019ll not want to hear my\nmoralising, Mr. Lockwood; you\u2019ll judge, as well as I can, all these\nthings: at least, you\u2019ll think you will, and that\u2019s the same. The end\nof Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his\nsister\u2019s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the\nGrange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;\nall that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the\npreparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to\nmy master.\n\n\u201cWell, Nelly,\u201d said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not\nto alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, \u201cit\u2019s yours and\nmy turn to go into mourning at present. Who\u2019s given us the slip now, do\nyou think?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked in a flurry.\n\n\u201cWhy, guess!\u201d he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a\nhook by the door. \u201cAnd nip up the corner of your apron: I\u2019m certain\nyou\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Mr. Heathcliff, surely?\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cWhat! would you have tears for him?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo,\nHeathcliff\u2019s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I\u2019ve just\nseen him. He\u2019s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?\u201d I repeated impatiently.\n\n\u201cHindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,\u201d he replied, \u201cand my wicked\ngossip: though he\u2019s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said\nwe should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character:\ndrunk as a lord. Poor lad! I\u2019m sorry, too. One can\u2019t help missing an\nold companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man\nimagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He\u2019s barely\ntwenty-seven, it seems; that\u2019s your own age: who would have thought you\nwere born in one year?\u201d\n\nI confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton\u2019s\ndeath: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the\nporch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get\nanother servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder\nmyself from pondering on the question\u2014\u201cHad he had fair play?\u201d Whatever\nI did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious\nthat I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and\nassist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely\nreluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless\ncondition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother\nhad a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded\nhim that the child Hareton was his wife\u2019s nephew, and, in the absence\nof nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and\nmust inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of\nhis brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,\nbut he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.\nHis lawyer had been Earnshaw\u2019s also: I called at the village, and asked\nhim to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff\nshould be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would\nbe found little else than a beggar.\n\n\u201cHis father died in debt,\u201d he said; \u201cthe whole property is mortgaged,\nand the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity\nof creating some interest in the creditor\u2019s heart, that he may be\ninclined to deal leniently towards him.\u201d\n\nWhen I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see\neverything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient\ndistress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he\ndid not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the\narrangements for the funeral, if I chose.\n\n\u201cCorrectly,\u201d he remarked, \u201cthat fool\u2019s body should be buried at the\ncross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten\nminutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two\ndoors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking\nhimself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard\nhim snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:\nflaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth,\nand he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was\nboth dead and cold, and stark; and so you\u2019ll allow it was useless\nmaking more stir about him!\u201d\n\nThe old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rayther he\u2019d goan hisseln for t\u2019 doctor! I sud ha\u2019 taen tent o\u2019 t\u2019\nmaister better nor him\u2014and he warn\u2019t deead when I left, naught o\u2019 t\u2019\nsoart!\u201d\n\nI insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I\nmight have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that\nthe money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a\nhard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if\nanything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult\nwork successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like\nexultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the\ncoffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and\nprevious to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on\nto the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, \u201cNow, my bonny lad, you\nare _mine_! And we\u2019ll see if one tree won\u2019t grow as crooked as another,\nwith the same wind to twist it!\u201d The unsuspecting thing was pleased at\nthis speech: he played with Heathcliff\u2019s whiskers, and stroked his\ncheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, \u201cThat boy must\ngo back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the\nworld less yours than he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Linton say so?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cOf course\u2014he has ordered me to take him,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the scoundrel, \u201cwe\u2019ll not argue the subject now: but I\nhave a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your\nmaster that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt\nto remove it. I don\u2019t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I\u2019ll be\npretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.\u201d\n\nThis hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my\nreturn; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke\nno more of interfering. I\u2019m not aware that he could have done it to any\npurpose, had he been ever so willing.\n\nThe guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm\npossession, and proved to the attorney\u2014who, in his turn, proved it to\nMr. Linton\u2014that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for\ncash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the\nmortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first\ngentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete\ndependence on his father\u2019s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house\nas a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right\nhimself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has\nbeen wronged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThe twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period\nwere the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage\nrose from our little lady\u2019s trifling illnesses, which she had to\nexperience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest,\nafter the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and\ntalk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over\nMrs. Linton\u2019s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought\nsunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the\nEarnshaws\u2019 handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons\u2019 fair skin and small\nfeatures, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not\nrough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its\naffections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her\nmother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild\nas a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger\nwas never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A\npropensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged\nchildren invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If\na servant chanced to vex her, it was always\u2014\u201cI shall tell papa!\u201d And if\nhe reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a\nheart-breaking business: I don\u2019t believe he ever did speak a harsh word\nto her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an\namusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt\nscholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his\nteaching.\n\nTill she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the\nrange of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile\nor so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.\nGimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only\nbuilding she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering\nHeights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect\nrecluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while\nsurveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe\u2014\n\n\u201cEllen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those\nhills? I wonder what lies on the other side\u2014is it the sea?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Miss Cathy,\u201d I would answer; \u201cit is hills again, just like these.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?\u201d she\nonce asked.\n\nThe abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her\nnotice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost\nheights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I\nexplained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth\nin their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.\n\n\u201cAnd why are they bright so long after it is evening here?\u201d she\npursued.\n\n\u201cBecause they are a great deal higher up than we are,\u201d replied I; \u201cyou\ncould not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost\nis always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have\nfound snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you have been on them!\u201d she cried gleefully. \u201cThen I can go, too,\nwhen I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa would tell you, Miss,\u201d I answered, hastily, \u201cthat they are not\nworth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him,\nare much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I know the park, and I don\u2019t know those,\u201d she murmured to herself.\n\u201cAnd I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest\npoint: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.\u201d\n\nOne of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with\na desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he\npromised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss\nCatherine measured her age by months, and, \u201cNow, am I old enough to go\nto Penistone Crags?\u201d was the constant question in her mouth. The road\nthither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to\npass it; so she received as constantly the answer, \u201cNot yet, love: not\nyet.\u201d\n\nI said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her\nhusband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both\nlacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.\nWhat her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of\nthe same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but\nincurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to\ninform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months\u2019\nindisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come\nto her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid\nhim adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that\nLinton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she\nwould fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his\nmaintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying\nwith her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,\nhe flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,\nin his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of\nthe park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going\nunaccompanied.\n\nHe was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner\nof the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet\nstate she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval\nof impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,\nto run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might\nentertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the\ngrounds\u2014now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient\naudience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.\n\nThe summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this\nsolitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast\ntill tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful\ntales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were\ngenerally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,\nif they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.\nCatherine came to me, one morning, at eight o\u2019clock, and said she was\nthat day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his\ncaravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and\nbeasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a\ncouple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung\nthem in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as\na fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July\nsun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to\navoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her\nappearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond\nof its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two\npointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down\nthis path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her\nmyself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on\nthe borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young\nlady.\n\n\u201cI saw her at morn,\u201d he replied: \u201cshe would have me to cut her a hazel\nswitch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it\nis lowest, and galloped out of sight.\u201d\n\nYou may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly\nshe must have started for Penistone Crags. \u201cWhat will become of her?\u201d I\nejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and\nmaking straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile\nafter mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no\nCatherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a\nhalf beyond Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s place, and that is four from the Grange,\nso I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. \u201cAnd what\nif she should have slipped in clambering among them,\u201d I reflected, \u201cand\nbeen killed, or broken some of her bones?\u201d My suspense was truly\npainful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in\nhurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying\nunder a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket\nand ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I\nknew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been\nservant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said she, \u201cyou are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don\u2019t be\nfrightened. She\u2019s here safe: but I\u2019m glad it isn\u2019t the master.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not at home then, is he?\u201d I panted, quite breathless with quick\nwalking and alarm.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she replied: \u201cboth he and Joseph are off, and I think they\nwon\u2019t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.\u201d\n\nI entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking\nherself in a little chair that had been her mother\u2019s when a child. Her\nhat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,\nlaughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton\u2014now\na great, strong lad of eighteen\u2014who stared at her with considerable\ncuriosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent\nsuccession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased\npouring forth.\n\n\u201cVery well, Miss!\u201d I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry\ncountenance. \u201cThis is your last ride, till papa comes back. I\u2019ll not\ntrust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cAha, Ellen!\u201d she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. \u201cI\nshall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you\u2019ve found me out.\nHave you ever been here in your life before?\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that hat on, and home at once,\u201d said I. \u201cI\u2019m dreadfully grieved at\nyou, Miss Cathy: you\u2019ve done extremely wrong! It\u2019s no use pouting and\ncrying: that won\u2019t repay the trouble I\u2019ve had, scouring the country\nafter you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you\nstealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will\nput faith in you any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d sobbed she, instantly checked. \u201cPapa charged me\nnothing: he\u2019ll not scold me, Ellen\u2014he\u2019s never cross, like you!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d I repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no\npetulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!\u201d\n\nThis exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and\nretreating to the chimney out of my reach.\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said the servant, \u201cdon\u2019t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.\nWe made her stop: she\u2019d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be\nuneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it\u2019s a\nwild road over the hills.\u201d\n\nHareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,\ntoo awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my\nintrusion.\n\n\u201cHow long am I to wait?\u201d I continued, disregarding the woman\u2019s\ninterference. \u201cIt will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss\nCathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so\nplease yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pony is in the yard,\u201d she replied, \u201cand Phoenix is shut in there.\nHe\u2019s bitten\u2014and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;\nbut you are in a bad temper, and don\u2019t deserve to hear.\u201d\n\nI picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving\nthat the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering\nround the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under\nand behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.\nHareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more\nimpertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,\u2014\u201cWell, Miss\nCathy, if you were aware whose house this is you\u2019d be glad enough to\nget out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s _your_ father\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said she, turning to Hareton.\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.\n\nHe could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just\nhis own.\n\n\u201cWhose then\u2014your master\u2019s?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and\nturned away.\n\n\u201cWho is his master?\u201d continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. \u201cHe\ntalked about \u2018our house,\u2019 and \u2018our folk.\u2019 I thought he had been the\nowner\u2019s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn\u2019t he,\nif he\u2019s a servant?\u201d\n\nHareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I\nsilently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her\nfor departure.\n\n\u201cNow, get my horse,\u201d she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she\nwould one of the stable-boys at the Grange. \u201cAnd you may come with me.\nI want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear\nabout the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What\u2019s the\nmatter? Get my horse, I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!\u201d growled the lad.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me _what?_\u201d asked Catherine in surprise.\n\n\u201cDamned\u2014thou saucy witch!\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cThere, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,\u201d I\ninterposed. \u201cNice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don\u2019t begin to\ndispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Ellen,\u201d cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, \u201chow dare he\nspeak so to me? Mustn\u2019t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked\ncreature, I shall tell papa what you said.\u2014Now, then!\u201d\n\nHareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into\nher eyes with indignation. \u201cYou bring the pony,\u201d she exclaimed, turning\nto the woman, \u201cand let my dog free this moment!\u201d\n\n\u201cSoftly, Miss,\u201d answered the addressed. \u201cYou\u2019ll lose nothing by being\ncivil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master\u2019s son, he\u2019s your\ncousin: and I was never hired to serve you.\u201d\n\n\u201c_He_ my cousin!\u201d cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d responded her reprover.\n\n\u201cOh, Ellen! don\u2019t let them say such things,\u201d she pursued in great\ntrouble. \u201cPapa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a\ngentleman\u2019s son. That my\u2014\u201d she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the\nbare notion of relationship with such a clown.\n\n\u201cHush, hush!\u201d I whispered; \u201cpeople can have many cousins and of all\nsorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they\nneedn\u2019t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014he\u2019s not my cousin, Ellen!\u201d she went on, gathering fresh\ngrief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge\nfrom the idea.\n\nI was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;\nhaving no doubt of Linton\u2019s approaching arrival, communicated by the\nformer, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that\nCatherine\u2019s first thought on her father\u2019s return would be to seek an\nexplanation of the latter\u2019s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.\nHareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,\nseemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the\ndoor, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp\nfrom the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he\nmeant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a\nglance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.\n\nI could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor\nfellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,\nand stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily\noccupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after\nrabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a\nmind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good\nthings lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far\nover-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a\nwealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and\nfavourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated\nhim physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no\ntemptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid\nsusceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in\nHeathcliff\u2019s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on\nmaking him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked\nfor any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single\nstep towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And\nfrom what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a\nnarrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as\na boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in\nthe habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,\nof putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek\nsolace in drink by what he termed their \u201coffald ways,\u201d so at present he\nlaid the whole burden of Hareton\u2019s faults on the shoulders of the\nusurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn\u2019t correct him: nor\nhowever culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,\nto watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:\nthat his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that\nHeathcliff must answer for it. Hareton\u2019s blood would be required at his\nhands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had\ninstilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had\nhe dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the\nHeights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he\nconfined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private\ncomminations. I don\u2019t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode\nof living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak\nfrom hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff\nwas _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,\ninside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female\nmanagement, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley\u2019s time were not\nnow enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek\ncompanionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.\n\nThis, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy\nrejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,\nCharlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we\nset out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not\nwring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I\nsupposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she\narrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton\nhappened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who\nattacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could\nseparate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who\nshe was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:\nfinally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the\nFairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I\nwas not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.\nI could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she\nhurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff\u2019s\nhousekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he\nhad held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always \u201clove,\u201d and\n\u201cdarling,\u201d and \u201cqueen,\u201d and \u201cangel,\u201d with everybody at the Grange, to\nbe insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and\nhard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the\ngrievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole\nhousehold at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had\nbeen there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my\nnegligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should\nhave to leave; and Cathy couldn\u2019t bear that prospect: she pledged her\nword, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nA letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master\u2019s return.\nIsabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his\ndaughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his\nyouthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming\nher father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the\ninnumerable excellencies of her \u201creal\u201d cousin. The evening of their\nexpected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering\nher own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock\u2014poor\nthing! her aunt\u2019s death impressed her with no definite sorrow\u2014she\nobliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the\ngrounds to meet them.\n\n\u201cLinton is just six months younger than I am,\u201d she chattered, as we\nstrolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under\nshadow of the trees. \u201cHow delightful it will be to have him for a\nplayfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it\nwas lighter than mine\u2014more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it\ncarefully preserved in a little glass box; and I\u2019ve often thought what\na pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy\u2014and papa, dear,\ndear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.\u201d\n\nShe ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober\nfootsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy\nbank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was\nimpossible: she couldn\u2019t be still a minute.\n\n\u201cHow long they are!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cAh, I see some dust on the\nroad\u2014they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a\nlittle way\u2014half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to\nthat clump of birches at the turn!\u201d\n\nI refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling\ncarriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her\narms as soon as she caught her father\u2019s face looking from the window.\nHe descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval\nelapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While\nthey exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was\nasleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had\nbeen winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been\ntaken for my master\u2019s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:\nbut there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton\nnever had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised\nme to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had\nfatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father\ntold her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I\nhastened before to prepare the servants.\n\n\u201cNow, darling,\u201d said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they\nhalted at the bottom of the front steps: \u201cyour cousin is not so strong\nor so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very\nshort time since; therefore, don\u2019t expect him to play and run about\nwith you directly. And don\u2019t harass him much by talking: let him be\nquiet this evening, at least, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, papa,\u201d answered Catherine: \u201cbut I do want to see him; and he\nhasn\u2019t once looked out.\u201d\n\nThe carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the\nground by his uncle.\n\n\u201cThis is your cousin Cathy, Linton,\u201d he said, putting their little\nhands together. \u201cShe\u2019s fond of you already; and mind you don\u2019t grieve\nher by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an\nend, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you\nplease.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me go to bed, then,\u201d answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine\u2019s\nsalute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.\n\n\u201cCome, come, there\u2019s a good child,\u201d I whispered, leading him in.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make her weep too\u2014see how sorry she is for you!\u201d\n\nI do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as\nsad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three\nentered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I\nproceeded to remove Linton\u2019s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair\nby the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.\nMy master inquired what was the matter.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit on a chair,\u201d sobbed the boy.\n\n\u201cGo to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,\u201d answered\nhis uncle patiently.\n\nHe had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his\nfretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.\nCathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat\nsilent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her\nlittle cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking\nhis curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,\nlike a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his\neyes, and lightened into a faint smile.\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019ll do very well,\u201d said the master to me, after watching them a\nminute. \u201cVery well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child\nof his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for\nstrength he\u2019ll gain it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, if we can keep him!\u201d I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came\nover me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how\never will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father\nand Hareton, what playmates and instructors they\u2019ll be. Our doubts were\npresently decided\u2014even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the\nchildren upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep\u2014he\nwould not suffer me to leave him till that was the case\u2014I had come\ndown, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom\ncandle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and\ninformed me that Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s servant Joseph was at the door, and\nwished to speak with the master.\n\n\u201cI shall ask him what he wants first,\u201d I said, in considerable\ntrepidation. \u201cA very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the\ninstant they have returned from a long journey. I don\u2019t think the\nmaster can see him.\u201d\n\nJoseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and\nnow presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday\ngarments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding\nhis hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean\nhis shoes on the mat.\n\n\u201cGood-evening, Joseph,\u201d I said, coldly. \u201cWhat business brings you here\nto-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Maister Linton I mun spake to,\u201d he answered, waving me\ndisdainfully aside.\n\n\u201cMr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to\nsay, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t hear it now,\u201d I continued. \u201cYou had better sit\ndown in there, and entrust your message to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is his rahm?\u201d pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed\ndoors.\n\nI perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I\nwent up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,\nadvising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no\ntime to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,\npushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the\ntable, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began\nin an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition\u2014\n\n\u201cHathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn\u2019t goa back \u2019bout him.\u201d\n\nEdgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow\novercast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own\naccount; but, recalling Isabella\u2019s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes\nfor her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved\nbitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart\nhow it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of\nany desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more\nperemptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was\nnot going to rouse him from his sleep.\n\n\u201cTell Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d he answered calmly, \u201cthat his son shall come to\nWuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the\ndistance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired\nhim to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is\nvery precarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoa!\u201d said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and\nassuming an authoritative air. \u201cNoa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks\nnoa \u2019count o\u2019 t\u2019 mother, nor ye norther; but he\u2019ll hev his lad; und I\nmun tak\u2019 him\u2014soa now ye knaw!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall not to-night!\u201d answered Linton decisively. \u201cWalk down stairs\nat once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him\ndown. Go\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room\nof him and closed the door.\n\n\u201cVarrah weell!\u201d shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. \u201cTo-morn, he\u2019s\ncome hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nTo obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton\ncommissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine\u2019s pony; and,\nsaid he\u2014\u201cAs we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or\nbad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she\ncannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain\nin ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious\nto visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,\nand he has been obliged to leave us.\u201d\n\nLinton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o\u2019clock,\nand astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further\ntravelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going\nto spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see\nhim so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should\nrecover from his late journey.\n\n\u201cMy father!\u201d he cried, in strange perplexity. \u201cMamma never told me I\nhad a father. Where does he live? I\u2019d rather stay with uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lives a little distance from the Grange,\u201d I replied; \u201cjust beyond\nthose hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get\nhearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try\nto love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why have I not heard of him before?\u201d asked Linton. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t\nmamma and he live together, as other people do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had business to keep him in the north,\u201d I answered, \u201cand your\nmother\u2019s health required her to reside in the south.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t mamma speak to me about him?\u201d persevered the child.\n\u201cShe often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I\nto love papa? I don\u2019t know him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all children love their parents,\u201d I said. \u201cYour mother, perhaps,\nthought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to\nyou. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is\nmuch preferable to an hour\u2019s more sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs _she_ to go with us,\u201d he demanded, \u201cthe little girl I saw\nyesterday?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d replied I.\n\n\u201cIs uncle?\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cNo, I shall be your companion there,\u201d I said.\n\nLinton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go without uncle,\u201d he cried at length: \u201cI can\u2019t tell where you\nmean to take me.\u201d\n\nI attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to\nmeet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards\ndressing, and I had to call for my master\u2019s assistance in coaxing him\nout of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive\nassurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy\nwould visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I\ninvented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure\nheather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of\nMinny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put\nquestions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater\ninterest and liveliness.\n\n\u201cIs Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?\u201d he\ninquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light\nmist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.\n\n\u201cIt is not so buried in trees,\u201d I replied, \u201cand it is not quite so\nlarge, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air\nis healthier for you\u2014fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the\nbuilding old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the\nnext best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on\nthe moors. Hareton Earnshaw\u2014that is, Miss Cathy\u2019s other cousin, and so\nyours in a manner\u2014will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can\nbring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,\nnow and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,\nwalk out on the hills.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is my father like?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs he as young and handsome as\nuncle?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as young,\u201d said I; \u201cbut he has black hair and eyes, and looks\nsterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He\u2019ll not seem to you\nso gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,\nmind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he\u2019ll be fonder\nof you than any uncle, for you are his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack hair and eyes!\u201d mused Linton. \u201cI can\u2019t fancy him. Then I am not\nlike him, am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret\nthe white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large\nlanguid eyes\u2014his mother\u2019s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness\nkindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.\n\n\u201cHow strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!\u201d he\nmurmured. \u201cHas he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I\nremember not a single thing about him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Master Linton,\u201d said I, \u201cthree hundred miles is a great distance;\nand ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person\ncompared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff\nproposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient\nopportunity; and now it is too late. Don\u2019t trouble him with questions\non the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.\u201d\n\nThe boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder\nof the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched\nto catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved\nfront and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and\ncrooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his\nprivate feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.\nBut he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation\nwithin. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was\nhalf-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was\nclearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master\u2019s chair\ntelling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing\nfor the hayfield.\n\n\u201cHallo, Nelly!\u201d said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. \u201cI feared I should\nhave to come down and fetch my property myself. You\u2019ve brought it, have\nyou? Let us see what we can make of it.\u201d\n\nHe got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping\ncuriosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the\nthree.\n\n\u201cSure-ly,\u201d said Joseph after a grave inspection, \u201che\u2019s swopped wi\u2019 ye,\nMaister, an\u2019 yon\u2019s his lass!\u201d\n\nHeathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a\nscornful laugh.\n\n\u201cGod! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\u201cHav\u2019n\u2019t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my\nsoul! but that\u2019s worse than I expected\u2014and the devil knows I was not\nsanguine!\u201d\n\nI bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did\nnot thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father\u2019s speech, or\nwhether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that\nthe grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with\ngrowing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s taking a seat and bidding\nhim \u201ccome hither\u201d he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.\n\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him\nroughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.\n\u201cNone of that nonsense! We\u2019re not going to hurt thee, Linton\u2014isn\u2019t that\nthy name? Thou art thy mother\u2019s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in\nthee, puling chicken?\u201d\n\nHe took off the boy\u2019s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt\nhis slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton\nceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.\n\n\u201cDo you know me?\u201d asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the\nlimbs were all equally frail and feeble.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me, I daresay?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied again.\n\n\u201cNo! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for\nme! You are my son, then, I\u2019ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked\nslut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.\nNow, don\u2019t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you\nhave not white blood. Be a good lad; and I\u2019ll do for you. Nelly, if you\nbe tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you\u2019ll\nreport what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this\nthing won\u2019t be settled while you linger about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied I, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,\nor you\u2019ll not keep him long; and he\u2019s all you have akin in the wide\nworld, that you will ever know\u2014remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn\u2019t fear,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\u201cOnly nobody else must be kind to him: I\u2019m jealous of monopolising his\naffection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some\nbreakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,\u201d\nhe added, when they had departed, \u201cmy son is prospective owner of your\nplace, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his\nsuccessor. Besides, he\u2019s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_\ndescendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children\nto till their fathers\u2019 lands for wages. That is the sole consideration\nwhich can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate\nhim for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient:\nhe\u2019s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master\ntends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome\nstyle; I\u2019ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from\ntwenty miles\u2019 distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I\u2019ve\nordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I\u2019ve arranged everything with\na view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his\nassociates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the\ntrouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a\nworthy object of pride; and I\u2019m bitterly disappointed with the\nwhey-faced, whining wretch!\u201d\n\nWhile he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of\nmilk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the\nhomely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.\nI saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master\u2019s scorn of the\nchild; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,\nbecause Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.\n\n\u201cCannot ate it?\u201d repeated he, peering in Linton\u2019s face, and subduing\nhis voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. \u201cBut Maister\nHareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little \u2019un; and what wer\ngooid eneugh for him\u2019s gooid eneugh for ye, I\u2019s rayther think!\u201d\n\n\u201cI _sha\u2019n\u2019t_ eat it!\u201d answered Linton, snappishly. \u201cTake it away.\u201d\n\nJoseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.\n\n\u201cIs there aught ails th\u2019 victuals?\u201d he asked, thrusting the tray under\nHeathcliff\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cWhat should ail them?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWah!\u201d answered Joseph, \u201cyon dainty chap says he cannut ate \u2019em. But I\nguess it\u2019s raight! His mother wer just soa\u2014we wer a\u2019most too mucky to\nsow t\u2019 corn for makking her breead.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention his mother to me,\u201d said the master, angrily. \u201cGet him\nsomething that he can eat, that\u2019s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?\u201d\n\nI suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received\ninstructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father\u2019s\nselfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate\nconstitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I\u2019ll console\nMr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff\u2019s humour has\ntaken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while\nLinton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly\nsheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed\nthe door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me! I\u2019ll not stay here! I\u2019ll not stay here!\u201d\n\nThen the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come\nforth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief\nguardianship ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nWe had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,\neager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations\nfollowed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to\nsoothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,\n\u201cif I can get him\u201d; and there were no hopes of that. This promise\npoorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at\nintervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before\nshe did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that\nshe did not recognise him.\n\nWhen I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in\npaying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master\ngot on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\nnever to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak\nhealth, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\ndislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to\nconceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could\nnot do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes\ntogether. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his\nlessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the\nparlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting\ncoughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.\n\n\u201cAnd I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,\u201d added the woman; \u201cnor\none so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open\na bit late in the evening. Oh! it\u2019s killing, a breath of night air! And\nhe must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph\u2019s bacca-pipe is\npoison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,\nmilk for ever\u2014heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;\nand there he\u2019ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the\nfire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and\nif Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him\u2014Hareton is not bad-natured,\nthough he\u2019s rough\u2014they\u2019re sure to part, one swearing and the other\ncrying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw\u2019s thrashing him to a\nmummy, if he were not his son; and I\u2019m certain he would be fit to turn\nhim out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But\nthen he won\u2019t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the\nparlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he\nsends him upstairs directly.\u201d\n\nI divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered\nyoung Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so\noriginally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still\nI was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had\nbeen left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he\nthought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk\nto see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever\ncame into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback,\naccompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite\nknocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if\nI recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did\nnot know, was her successor; she lives there still.\n\nTime wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy\nreached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested\nany signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late\nmistress\u2019s death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the\nlibrary; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he\nwould frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine\nwas thrown on her own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March\nwas a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young\nlady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a\nramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave,\nif we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.\n\n\u201cSo make haste, Ellen!\u201d she cried. \u201cI know where I wish to go; where a\ncolony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made\ntheir nests yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat must be a good distance up,\u201d I answered; \u201cthey don\u2019t breed on the\nedge of the moor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone very near with papa.\u201d\n\nI put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the\nmatter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off\nagain like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of\nentertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and\nenjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my\ndelight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright\ncheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes\nradiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an\nangel, in those days. It\u2019s a pity she could not be content.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cwhere are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at\nthem: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a little further\u2014only a little further, Ellen,\u201d was her answer,\ncontinually. \u201cClimb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time\nyou reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.\u201d\n\nBut there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at\nlength, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our\nsteps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she\neither did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I\nwas compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I\ncame in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights\nthan her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of\nwhom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.\n\nCathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting\nout the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff\u2019s land, and he\nwas reproving the poacher.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve neither taken any nor found any,\u201d she said, as I toiled to them,\nexpanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I\nwished to see the eggs.\u201d\n\nHeathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his\nacquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards\nit, and demanded who \u201cpapa\u201d was?\n\n\u201cMr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,\u201d she replied. \u201cI thought you did not\nknow me, or you wouldn\u2019t have spoken in that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?\u201d he said,\nsarcastically.\n\n\u201cAnd what are you?\u201d inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the\nspeaker. \u201cThat man I\u2019ve seen before. Is he your son?\u201d\n\nShe pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing\nbut increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his\nage: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.\n\n\u201cMiss Cathy,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cit will be three hours instead of one\nthat we are out, presently. We really must go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that man is not my son,\u201d answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.\n\u201cBut I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your\nnurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a\nlittle rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my\nhouse? You\u2019ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a\nkind welcome.\u201d\n\nI whispered Catherine that she mustn\u2019t, on any account, accede to the\nproposal: it was entirely out of the question.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, aloud. \u201cI\u2019m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:\nI can\u2019t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his\nson. He\u2019s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the\nfarmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue\u2014it will be a treat for her to look\nin on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,\nNelly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s not going to any such place,\u201d I cried, struggling to release\nmy arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones\nalready, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed\ncompanion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,\nand vanished.\n\n\u201cMr. Heathcliff, it\u2019s very wrong,\u201d I continued: \u201cyou know you mean no\ngood. And there she\u2019ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever\nwe return; and I shall have the blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want her to see Linton,\u201d he answered; \u201che\u2019s looking better these few\ndays; it\u2019s not often he\u2019s fit to be seen. And we\u2019ll soon persuade her\nto keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I\nsuffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad\ndesign in encouraging her to do so,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cMy design is as honest as possible. I\u2019ll inform you of its whole\nscope,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the two cousins may fall in love, and get\nmarried. I\u2019m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no\nexpectations, and should she second my wishes she\u2019ll be provided for at\nonce as joint successor with Linton.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Linton died,\u201d I answered, \u201cand his life is quite uncertain,\nCatherine would be the heir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she would not,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no clause in the will to secure\nit so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire\ntheir union, and am resolved to bring it about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,\u201d I\nreturned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.\n\nHeathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to\nopen the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could\nnot exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled\nwhen he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I\nwas foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him\nfrom desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out\nwalking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph\nto bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting\nsome months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and\ncomplexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely\ntemporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.\n\n\u201cNow, who is that?\u201d asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. \u201cCan you\ntell?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour son?\u201d she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then\nthe other.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d answered he: \u201cbut is this the only time you have beheld\nhim? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don\u2019t you recall your\ncousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, Linton!\u201d cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.\n\u201cIs that little Linton? He\u2019s taller than I am! Are you Linton?\u201d\n\nThe youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him\nfervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in\nthe appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her\nfigure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole\naspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton\u2019s looks and movements\nwere very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace\nin his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not\nunpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his\ncousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his\nattention between the objects inside and those that lay without:\npretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the\nformer alone.\n\n\u201cAnd you are my uncle, then!\u201d she cried, reaching up to salute him. \u201cI\nthought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don\u2019t you\nvisit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close\nneighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI visited it once or twice too often before you were born,\u201d he\nanswered. \u201cThere\u2014damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to\nLinton: they are thrown away on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaughty Ellen!\u201d exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her\nlavish caresses. \u201cWicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But\nI\u2019ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and\nsometimes bring papa. Won\u2019t you be glad to see us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,\nresulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. \u201cBut\nstay,\u201d he continued, turning towards the young lady. \u201cNow I think of\nit, I\u2019d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we\nquarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if\nyou mention coming here to him, he\u2019ll put a veto on your visits\naltogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless\nof seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you\nmust not mention it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you quarrel?\u201d asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.\n\n\u201cHe thought me too poor to wed his sister,\u201d answered Heathcliff, \u201cand\nwas grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he\u2019ll never forgive\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong!\u201d said the young lady: \u201csome time I\u2019ll tell him so. But\nLinton and I have no share in your quarrel. I\u2019ll not come here, then;\nhe shall come to the Grange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be too far for me,\u201d murmured her cousin: \u201cto walk four miles\nwould kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every\nmorning, but once or twice a week.\u201d\n\nThe father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.\n\n\u201cI am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,\u201d he muttered to me. \u201cMiss\nCatherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send\nhim to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!\u2014Do you know that, twenty\ntimes a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I\u2019d have loved\nthe lad had he been some one else. But I think he\u2019s safe from _her_\nlove. I\u2019ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir\nitself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.\nOh, confound the vapid thing! He\u2019s absorbed in drying his feet, and\nnever looks at her.\u2014Linton!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, father,\u201d answered the boy.\n\n\u201cHave you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit\nor a weasel\u2019s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your\nshoes; and into the stable to see your horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather sit here?\u201d asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a\ntone which expressed reluctance to move again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and\nevidently eager to be active.\n\nHe kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and\nwent into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for\nHareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young\nman had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks\nand his wetted hair.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll ask _you_, uncle,\u201d cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the\nhousekeeper\u2019s assertion. \u201cThat is not my cousin, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cyour mother\u2019s nephew. Don\u2019t you like him?\u201d\n\nCatherine looked queer.\n\n\u201cIs he not a handsome lad?\u201d he continued.\n\nThe uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in\nHeathcliff\u2019s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very\nsensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his\ninferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming\u2014\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a\u2014What was\nit? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the\nfarm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don\u2019t use any bad words; and\ndon\u2019t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to\nhide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,\nand keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as\nnicely as you can.\u201d\n\nHe watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his\ncountenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying\nthe familiar landscape with a stranger\u2019s and an artist\u2019s interest.\nCatherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then\nturned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,\nand tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of\nconversation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tied his tongue,\u201d observed Heathcliff. \u201cHe\u2019ll not venture a\nsingle syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age\u2014nay,\nsome years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so \u2018gaumless,\u2019 as Joseph\ncalls it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d I replied, \u201cbecause more sullen with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve a pleasure in him,\u201d he continued, reflecting aloud. \u201cHe has\nsatisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it\nhalf so much. But he\u2019s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his\nfeelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for\ninstance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,\nthough. And he\u2019ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness\nand ignorance. I\u2019ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father\nsecured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I\u2019ve\ntaught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don\u2019t\nyou think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?\nalmost as proud as I am of mine. But there\u2019s this difference; one is\ngold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to\nape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I\nshall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.\n_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than\nunavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,\nbut I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of\nme! You\u2019ll own that I\u2019ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain\ncould rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring\u2019s wrongs, I\nshould have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,\nindignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the\nworld!\u201d\n\nHeathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,\nbecause I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who\nsat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms\nof uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat\nof Catherine\u2019s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father\nremarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand\nirresolutely extended towards his cap.\n\n\u201cGet up, you idle boy!\u201d he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. \u201cAway\nafter them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.\u201d\n\nLinton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was\nopen, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable\nattendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up,\nand scratched his head like a true clown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some damnable writing,\u201d he answered. \u201cI cannot read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t read it?\u201d cried Catherine; \u201cI can read it: it\u2019s English. But I\nwant to know why it is there.\u201d\n\nLinton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.\n\n\u201cHe does not know his letters,\u201d he said to his cousin. \u201cCould you\nbelieve in the existence of such a colossal dunce?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he all as he should be?\u201d asked Miss Cathy, seriously; \u201cor is he\nsimple: not right? I\u2019ve questioned him twice now, and each time he\nlooked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly\nunderstand _him_, I\u2019m sure!\u201d\n\nLinton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who\ncertainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the\nconsequence of scorning \u2018book-larning,\u2019 as you would say. Have you\nnoticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, where the devil is the use on\u2019t?\u201d growled Hareton, more ready in\nanswering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the\ntwo youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being\ndelighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of\namusement.\n\n\u201cWhere is the use of the devil in that sentence?\u201d tittered Linton.\n\u201cPapa told you not to say any bad words, and you can\u2019t open your mouth\nwithout one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf thou weren\u2019t more a lass than a lad, I\u2019d fell thee this minute, I\nwould; pitiful lath of a crater!\u201d retorted the angry boor, retreating,\nwhile his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was\nconscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.\n\nMr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled\nwhen he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular\naversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:\nthe boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton\u2019s faults and\ndeficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl\nrelishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the\nill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate\nLinton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.\n\nWe stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but\nhappily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant\nof our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have\nenlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:\nbut she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d she cried, \u201cyou take papa\u2019s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;\nor else you wouldn\u2019t have cheated me so many years into the notion that\nLinton lived a long way from here. I\u2019m really extremely angry; only I\u2019m\nso pleased I can\u2019t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my\nuncle; he\u2019s _my_ uncle, remember; and I\u2019ll scold papa for quarrelling\nwith him.\u201d\n\nAnd so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of\nher mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did\nnot see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and\nstill I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and\nwarning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too\ntimid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun\nconnection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good\nreasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.\n\n\u201cPapa!\u201d she exclaimed, after the morning\u2019s salutations, \u201cguess whom I\nsaw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you\u2019ve\nnot done right, have you, now? I saw\u2014but listen, and you shall hear how\nI found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet\npretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always\ndisappointed about Linton\u2019s coming back!\u201d\n\nShe gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and\nmy master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said\nnothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if\nshe knew why he had concealed Linton\u2019s near neighbourhood from her?\nCould she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly\nenjoy?\n\n\u201cIt was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cThen you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?\u201d\nhe said. \u201cNo, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because\nMr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to\nwrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest\nopportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with\nyour cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he\nwould detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,\nI took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to\nexplain this some time as you grew older, and I\u2019m sorry I delayed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,\u201d observed Catherine, not\nat all convinced; \u201cand _he_ didn\u2019t object to our seeing each other: he\nsaid I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell\nyou, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for\nmarrying aunt Isabella. And you won\u2019t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:\nhe is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you\nare not.\u201d\n\nMy master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her\nuncle-in-law\u2019s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to\nIsabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his\nproperty. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for\nthough he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and\ndetestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since\nMrs. Linton\u2019s death. \u201cShe might have been living yet, if it had not\nbeen for him!\u201d was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,\nHeathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy\u2014conversant with no bad deeds\nexcept her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,\narising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day\nthey were committed\u2014was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could\nbrood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its\nplans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed\nand shocked at this new view of human nature\u2014excluded from all her\nstudies and all her ideas till now\u2014that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary\nto pursue the subject. He merely added: \u201cYou will know hereafter,\ndarling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to\nyour old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.\u201d\n\nCatherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a\ncouple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the\ngrounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when\nshe had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found\nher crying, on her knees by the bedside.\n\n\u201cOh, fie, silly child!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIf you had any real griefs you\u2019d\nbe ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had\none shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a\nminute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the\nworld: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such\nan affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,\ninstead of coveting more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not crying for myself, Ellen,\u201d she answered, \u201cit\u2019s for him. He\nexpected to see me again to-morrow, and there he\u2019ll be so disappointed:\nand he\u2019ll wait for me, and I sha\u2019n\u2019t come!\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said I, \u201cdo you imagine he has thought as much of you as\nyou have of him? Hasn\u2019t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a\nhundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for\ntwo afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself\nno further about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?\u201d she asked,\nrising to her feet. \u201cAnd just send those books I promised to lend him?\nHis books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them\nextremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not,\nEllen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed! no, indeed!\u201d replied I with decision. \u201cThen he would write\nto you, and there\u2019d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the\nacquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see\nthat it is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can one little note\u2014?\u201d she recommenced, putting on an\nimploring countenance.\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ll not begin with your little notes. Get\ninto bed.\u201d\n\nShe threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss\nher good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great\ndispleasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there\nwas Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and\na pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my\nentrance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,\u201d I said, \u201cif you write it;\nand at present I shall put out your candle.\u201d\n\nI set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my\nhand and a petulant \u201ccross thing!\u201d I then quitted her again, and she\ndrew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was\nfinished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came\nfrom the village; but that I didn\u2019t learn till some time afterwards.\nWeeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew\nwondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I\ncame near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the\nbook, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose\npaper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming\ndown early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she\nwere expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in\na cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and\nwhose key she took special care to remove when she left it.\n\nOne day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings\nand trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into\nbits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I\ndetermined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as\nsoon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily\nfound among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I\nemptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to\nexamine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I\nwas still surprised to discover that they were a mass of\ncorrespondence\u2014daily almost, it must have been\u2014from Linton Heathcliff:\nanswers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were\nembarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious\nlove-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet\nwith touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more\nexperienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds\nof ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in\nthe affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,\nincorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don\u2019t know; but\nthey appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as\nI thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,\nrelocking the vacant drawer.\n\nFollowing her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the\nkitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain\nlittle boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked\nsomething into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went\nround by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought\nvalorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I\nsucceeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious\nconsequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall\nand perused Miss Cathy\u2019s affectionate composition. It was more simple\nand more eloquent than her cousin\u2019s: very pretty and very silly. I\nshook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet,\nshe could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the\nconclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the\ndrawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had\nsought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,\nkeeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird\nflying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping\nyoung ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and\nflutterings, than she by her single \u201cOh!\u201d and the change that\ntransfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?\u201d he said.\n\nHis tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the\nhoard.\n\n\u201cNo, papa!\u201d she gasped. \u201cEllen! Ellen! come upstairs\u2014I\u2019m sick!\u201d\n\nI obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.\n\n\u201cOh, Ellen! you have got them,\u201d she commenced immediately, dropping on\nher knees, when we were enclosed alone. \u201cOh, give them to me, and I\u2019ll\nnever, never do so again! Don\u2019t tell papa. You have not told papa,\nEllen? say you have not? I\u2019ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won\u2019t do\nit any more!\u201d\n\nWith a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cMiss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:\nyou may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in\nyour leisure hours, to be sure: why, it\u2019s good enough to be printed!\nAnd what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before\nhim? I hav\u2019n\u2019t shown it yet, but you needn\u2019t imagine I shall keep your\nridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing\nsuch absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I\u2019m certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t!\u201d sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nonce think of loving him till\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Loving_!\u201d cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.\n\u201c_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of\nloving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving,\nindeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours\nin your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I\u2019m going with it to the\nlibrary; and we\u2019ll see what your father says to such _loving_.\u201d\n\nShe sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and\nthen she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn\nthem\u2014do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much\ninclined to laugh as scold\u2014for I esteemed it all girlish vanity\u2014I at\nlength relented in a measure, and asked,\u2014\u201cIf I consent to burn them,\nwill you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,\nnor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,\nnor rings, nor playthings?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t send playthings,\u201d cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her\nshame.\n\n\u201cNor anything at all, then, my lady?\u201d I said. \u201cUnless you will, here I\ngo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise, Ellen!\u201d she cried, catching my dress. \u201cOh, put them in the\nfire, do, do!\u201d\n\nBut when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was\ntoo painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare\nher one or two.\n\n\u201cOne or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\nI unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an\nangle, and the flame curled up the chimney.\n\n\u201cI will have one, you cruel wretch!\u201d she screamed, darting her hand\ninto the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the\nexpense of her fingers.\n\n\u201cVery well\u2014and I will have some to exhibit to papa!\u201d I answered,\nshaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.\n\nShe emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to\nfinish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and\ninterred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a\nsense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended\nto tell my master that the young lady\u2019s qualm of sickness was almost\ngone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn\u2019t\ndine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and\nmarvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the\nletter by a slip of paper, inscribed, \u201cMaster Heathcliff is requested\nto send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.\u201d\nAnd, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nSummer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but\nthe harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still\nuncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among\nthe reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,\nand the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad\ncold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors\nthroughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.\n\nPoor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably\nsadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her\nreading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no\nlonger; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,\nwith mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or\nthree hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her\nfootsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.\n\nOn an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November\u2014a fresh watery\nafternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered\nleaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds\u2014dark grey\nstreamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain\u2014I\nrequested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of\nshowers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my\numbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a\nformal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited\u2014and that she\ninvariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing\nnever known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from\nhis increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went\nsadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind\nmight well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my\neye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her\ncheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side\nof the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,\nwith their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too\nloose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly\nhorizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these\ntrunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;\nand I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still\nconsidered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an\nelevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.\nFrom dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing\nnothing except singing old songs\u2014my nursery lore\u2014to herself, or\nwatching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to\nfly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,\nhappier than words can express.\n\n\u201cLook, Miss!\u201d I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one\ntwisted tree. \u201cWinter is not here yet. There\u2019s a little flower up\nyonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those\nturf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it\nto show to papa?\u201d\n\nCathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy\nshelter, and replied, at length\u2014\u201cNo, I\u2019ll not touch it: but it looks\nmelancholy, does it not, Ellen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I observed, \u201cabout as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks\nare bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You\u2019re so low, I\ndaresay I shall keep up with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals\nto muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus\nspreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever\nand anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.\n\n\u201cCatherine, why are you crying, love?\u201d I asked, approaching and putting\nmy arm over her shoulder. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t cry because papa has a cold; be\nthankful it is nothing worse.\u201d\n\nShe now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled\nby sobs.\n\n\u201cOh, it _will_ be something worse,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what shall I do when\npapa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can\u2019t forget your words,\nEllen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary\nthe world will be, when papa and you are dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone can tell whether you won\u2019t die before us,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong\nto anticipate evil. We\u2019ll hope there are years and years to come before\nany of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.\nMy mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr.\nLinton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you\nhave counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity\nabove twenty years beforehand?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,\u201d she remarked, gazing up with\ntimid hope to seek further consolation.\n\n\u201cAunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,\u201d I replied. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t\nas happy as Master: she hadn\u2019t as much to live for. All you need do, is\nto wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you\ncheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,\nCathy! I\u2019ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and\nreckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a\nperson who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to\ndiscover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it\nexpedient to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fret about nothing on earth except papa\u2019s illness,\u201d answered my\ncompanion. \u201cI care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I\u2019ll\nnever\u2014never\u2014oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word\nto vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by\nthis: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would\nrather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him\nbetter than myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood words,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut deeds must prove it also; and after he is\nwell, remember you don\u2019t forget resolutions formed in the hour of\nfear.\u201d\n\nAs we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young\nlady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on\nthe top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed\nscarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the\nhighway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could\ntouch the upper, except from Cathy\u2019s present station. In stretching to\npull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed\nscrambling down to recover it. I bid her be cautious lest she got a\nfall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy\nmatter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes\nand blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.\nI, like a fool, didn\u2019t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and\nexclaiming\u2014\u201cEllen! you\u2019ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run\nround to the porter\u2019s lodge. I can\u2019t scale the ramparts on this side!\u201d\n\n\u201cStay where you are,\u201d I answered; \u201cI have my bundle of keys in my\npocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nCatherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while\nI tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and\nfound that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain\nthere, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an\napproaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy\u2019s\ndance stopped also.\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cEllen, I wish you could open the door,\u201d whispered back my companion,\nanxiously.\n\n\u201cHo, Miss Linton!\u201d cried a deep voice (the rider\u2019s), \u201cI\u2019m glad to meet\nyou. Don\u2019t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and\nobtain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d answered Catherine. \u201cPapa\nsays you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says\nthe same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is nothing to the purpose,\u201d said Heathcliff. (He it was.) \u201cI\ndon\u2019t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand\nyour attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months\nsince, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in\nplay, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially,\nthe elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. I\u2019ve got your letters,\nand if you give me any pertness I\u2019ll send them to your father. I\npresume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn\u2019t you?\nWell, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in\nearnest: in love, really. As true as I live, he\u2019s dying for you;\nbreaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.\nThough Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have\nused more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his\nidiocy, he gets worse daily; and he\u2019ll be under the sod before summer,\nunless you restore him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?\u201d I called from the\ninside. \u201cPray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry\nfalsehoods? Miss Cathy, I\u2019ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won\u2019t\nbelieve that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible\nthat a person should die for love of a stranger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not aware there were eavesdroppers,\u201d muttered the detected\nvillain. \u201cWorthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don\u2019t like your\ndouble-dealing,\u201d he added aloud. \u201cHow could _you_ lie so glaringly as\nto affirm I hated the \u2018poor child\u2019? and invent bugbear stories to\nterrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms\nme), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I\nhave not spoken truth: do, there\u2019s a darling! Just imagine your father\nin my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your\ncareless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your\nfather himself entreated him; and don\u2019t, from pure stupidity, fall into\nthe same error. I swear, on my salvation, he\u2019s going to his grave, and\nnone but you can save him!\u201d\n\nThe lock gave way and I issued out.\n\n\u201cI swear Linton is dying,\u201d repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.\n\u201cAnd grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you\nwon\u2019t let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return\ntill this time next week; and I think your master himself would\nscarcely object to her visiting her cousin.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to\nre-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of\nthe speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.\n\nHe pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed\u2014\n\n\u201cMiss Catherine, I\u2019ll own to you that I have little patience with\nLinton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I\u2019ll own that he\u2019s with a\nharsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from\nyou would be his best medicine. Don\u2019t mind Mrs. Dean\u2019s cruel cautions;\nbut be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and\nnight, and cannot be persuaded that you don\u2019t hate him, since you\nneither write nor call.\u201d\n\nI closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in\nholding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for\nthe rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and\nwarned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the\nencounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined\ninstinctively that Catherine\u2019s heart was clouded now in double\ndarkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she\nevidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.\n\nThe master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his\nroom to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and\nasked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and\nafterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she\nwas weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she supposed\nme absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it\nappeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy\nit a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.\nHeathcliff\u2019s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would\ncoincide. Alas! I hadn\u2019t skill to counteract the effect his account had\nproduced: it was just what he intended.\n\n\u201cYou may be right, Ellen,\u201d she answered; \u201cbut I shall never feel at\nease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I\ndon\u2019t write, and convince him that I shall not change.\u201d\n\nWhat use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We\nparted that night\u2014hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to\nWuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress\u2019s pony. I\ncouldn\u2019t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected\ncountenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that\nLinton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the\ntale was founded on fact.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThe rainy night had ushered in a misty morning\u2014half frost, half\ndrizzle\u2014and temporary brooks crossed our path\u2014gurgling from the\nuplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly\nthe humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We\nentered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.\nHeathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own\naffirmation.\n\nJoseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring\nfire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces\nof toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine\nran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My\nquestion remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had\ngrown deaf, and repeated it louder.\n\n\u201cNa\u2014ay!\u201d he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. \u201cNa\u2014ay! yah\nmuh goa back whear yah coom frough.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoseph!\u201d cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner\nroom. \u201cHow often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now.\nJoseph! come this moment.\u201d\n\nVigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no\near for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one\ngone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew\nLinton\u2019s tones, and entered.\n\n\u201cOh, I hope you\u2019ll die in a garret, starved to death!\u201d said the boy,\nmistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.\n\nHe stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Miss Linton?\u201d he said, raising his head from the arm of\nthe great chair, in which he reclined. \u201cNo\u2014don\u2019t kiss me: it takes my\nbreath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,\u201d continued he, after\nrecovering a little from Catherine\u2019s embrace; while she stood by\nlooking very contrite. \u201cWill you shut the door, if you please? you left\nit open; and those\u2014those _detestable_ creatures won\u2019t bring coals to\nthe fire. It\u2019s so cold!\u201d\n\nI stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid\ncomplained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough,\nand looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.\n\n\u201cWell, Linton,\u201d murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,\n\u201care you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come before?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou should have come, instead\nof writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I\u2019d far\nrather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor\nanything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you\u201d (looking at me)\n\u201cstep into the kitchen and see?\u201d\n\nI had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to\nrun to and fro at his behest, I replied\u2014\n\n\u201cNobody is out there but Joseph.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to drink,\u201d he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. \u201cZillah is\nconstantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it\u2019s miserable!\nAnd I\u2019m obliged to come down here\u2014they resolved never to hear me\nupstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?\u201d I asked,\nperceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.\n\n\u201cAttentive? He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,\u201d he\ncried. \u201cThe wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton\nlaughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious\nbeings.\u201d\n\nCathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the\ndresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of\nwine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,\nappeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.\n\n\u201cAnd are you glad to see me?\u201d asked she, reiterating her former\nquestion, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.\n\n\u201cYes, I am. It\u2019s something new to hear a voice like yours!\u201d he replied.\n\u201cBut I have been vexed, because you wouldn\u2019t come. And papa swore it\nwas owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;\nand said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be\nmore the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you\ndon\u2019t despise me, do you, Miss\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,\u201d interrupted my young lady.\n\u201cDespise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than\nanybody living. I don\u2019t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not\ncome when he returns: will he stay away many days?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot many,\u201d answered Linton; \u201cbut he goes on to the moors frequently,\nsince the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two\nwith me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be\npeevish with you: you\u2019d not provoke me, and you\u2019d always be ready to\nhelp me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, \u201cif I could only\nget papa\u2019s consent, I\u2019d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I\nwish you were my brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you would like me as well as your father?\u201d observed he, more\ncheerfully. \u201cBut papa says you would love me better than him and all\nthe world, if you were my wife; so I\u2019d rather you were that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I should never love anybody better than papa,\u201d she returned\ngravely. \u201cAnd people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters\nand brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and\npapa would be as fond of you as he is of me.\u201d\n\nLinton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed\nthey did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father\u2019s aversion to\nher aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn\u2019t\nsucceed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much\nirritated, asserted her relation was false.\n\n\u201cPapa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,\u201d she answered pertly.\n\n\u201c_My_ papa scorns yours!\u201d cried Linton. \u201cHe calls him a sneaking fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYours is a wicked man,\u201d retorted Catherine; \u201cand you are very naughty\nto dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt\nIsabella leave him as she did.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave him,\u201d said the boy; \u201cyou sha\u2019n\u2019t contradict me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d cried my young lady.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell _you_ something!\u201d said Linton. \u201cYour mother hated your\nfather: now then.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.\n\n\u201cAnd she loved mine,\u201d added he.\n\n\u201cYou little liar! I hate you now!\u201d she panted, and her face grew red\nwith passion.\n\n\u201cShe did! she did!\u201d sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,\nand leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other\ndisputant, who stood behind.\n\n\u201cHush, Master Heathcliff!\u201d I said; \u201cthat\u2019s your father\u2019s tale, too, I\nsuppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t: you hold your tongue!\u201d he answered. \u201cShe did, she did,\nCatherine! she did, she did!\u201d\n\nCathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to\nfall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough\nthat soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even\nme. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the\nmischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit\nexhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down\nsilently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat\nopposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?\u201d I inquired, after waiting ten\nminutes.\n\n\u201cI wish _she_ felt as I do,\u201d he replied: \u201cspiteful, cruel thing!\nHareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was\nbetter to-day: and there\u2014\u201d his voice died in a whimper.\n\n\u201c_I_ didn\u2019t strike you!\u201d muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent\nanother burst of emotion.\n\nHe sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for\na quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for\nwhenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and\npathos into the inflexions of his voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you, Linton,\u201d she said at length, racked beyond\nendurance. \u201cBut _I_ couldn\u2019t have been hurt by that little push, and I\nhad no idea that you could, either: you\u2019re not much, are you, Linton?\nDon\u2019t let me go home thinking I\u2019ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak to you,\u201d he murmured; \u201cyou\u2019ve hurt me so that I shall\nlie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you\u2019d know\nwhat it was; but _you\u2019ll_ be comfortably asleep while I\u2019m in agony, and\nnobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful\nnights!\u201d And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.\n\n\u201cSince you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,\u201d I said, \u201cit\nwon\u2019t be Miss who spoils your ease: you\u2019d be the same had she never\ncome. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you\u2019ll get\nquieter when we leave you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust I go?\u201d asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. \u201cDo you want\nme to go, Linton?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t alter what you\u2019ve done,\u201d he replied pettishly, shrinking\nfrom her, \u201cunless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a\nfever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, I must go?\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cLet me alone, at least,\u201d said he; \u201cI can\u2019t bear your talking.\u201d\n\nShe lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome\nwhile; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a\nmovement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream.\nLinton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing\nin the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined\nto be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his\ndisposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to\nattempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,\nknelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet\nfrom lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.\n\n\u201cI shall lift him on to the settle,\u201d I said, \u201cand he may roll about as\nhe pleases: we can\u2019t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss\nCathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his\ncondition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then,\nthere he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care\nfor his nonsense, he\u2019ll be glad to lie still.\u201d\n\nShe placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he\nrejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a\nstone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do with that,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s not high enough.\u201d\n\nCatherine brought another to lay above it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s _too_ high,\u201d murmured the provoking thing.\n\n\u201cHow must I arrange it, then?\u201d she asked despairingly.\n\nHe twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and\nconverted her shoulder into a support.\n\n\u201cNo, that won\u2019t do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be content with the cushion,\nMaster Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we\ncannot remain five minutes longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, we can!\u201d replied Cathy. \u201cHe\u2019s good and patient now. He\u2019s\nbeginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will\nto-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare\nnot come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn\u2019t come, if\nI have hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must come, to cure me,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou ought to come, because\nyou have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when\nyou entered as I am at present\u2014was I?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t do it all,\u201d said his cousin. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ll be friends now. And\nyou want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you I did,\u201d he replied impatiently. \u201cSit on the settle and let\nme lean on your knee. That\u2019s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons\ntogether. Sit quite still and don\u2019t talk: but you may sing a song, if\nyou can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad\u2014one of\nthose you promised to teach me; or a story. I\u2019d rather have a ballad,\nthough: begin.\u201d\n\nCatherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment\npleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that\nanother, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on\nuntil the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,\nreturning for his dinner.\n\n\u201cAnd to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?\u201d asked young\nHeathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered, \u201cnor next day neither.\u201d She, however, gave a\ndifferent response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped\nand whispered in his ear.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!\u201d I commenced, when we were\nout of the house. \u201cYou are not dreaming of it, are you?\u201d\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll take good care,\u201d I continued: \u201cI\u2019ll have that lock mended,\nand you can escape by no way else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get over the wall,\u201d she said laughing. \u201cThe Grange is not a\nprison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I\u2019m almost\nseventeen: I\u2019m a woman. And I\u2019m certain Linton would recover quickly if\nhe had me to look after him. I\u2019m older than he is, you know, and wiser:\nless childish, am I not? And he\u2019ll soon do as I direct him, with some\nslight coaxing. He\u2019s a pretty little darling when he\u2019s good. I\u2019d make\nsuch a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,\nafter we were used to each other? Don\u2019t you like him, Ellen?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike him!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThe worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that\never struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,\nhe\u2019ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he\u2019ll see spring, indeed. And\nsmall loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us\nthat his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious\nand selfish he\u2019d be. I\u2019m glad you have no chance of having him for a\nhusband, Miss Catherine.\u201d\n\nMy companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his\ndeath so regardlessly wounded her feelings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s younger than I,\u201d she answered, after a protracted pause of\nmeditation, \u201cand he ought to live the longest: he will\u2014he must live as\nlong as I do. He\u2019s as strong now as when he first came into the north;\nI\u2019m positive of that. It\u2019s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa\nhas. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d I cried, \u201cafter all, we needn\u2019t trouble ourselves; for\nlisten, Miss,\u2014and mind, I\u2019ll keep my word,\u2014if you attempt going to\nWuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,\nand, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be\nrevived.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been revived,\u201d muttered Cathy, sulkily.\n\n\u201cMust not be continued, then,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to\ntoil in the rear.\n\nWe both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had\nbeen wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no\nexplanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change\nmy soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights\nhad done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and\nduring three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:\na calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am\nthankful to say, since.\n\nMy little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and\ncheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is\nwearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for\ncomplaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton\u2019s room she\nappeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement\nusurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;\nand she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a\nwarm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said\nher days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I\ngenerally needed nothing after six o\u2019clock, thus the evening was her\nown. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after\ntea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I\nremarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender\nfingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across\nthe moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAt the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move\nabout the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the\nevening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We\nwere in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,\nrather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not\nsuit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.\nShe selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about\nan hour; then came frequent questions.\n\n\u201cEllen, are not you tired? Hadn\u2019t you better lie down now? You\u2019ll be\nsick, keeping up so long, Ellen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, dear, I\u2019m not tired,\u201d I returned, continually.\n\nPerceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her\ndisrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,\nand\u2014\n\n\u201cEllen, I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive over then and talk,\u201d I answered.\n\nThat was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till\neight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;\njudging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she\ninflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient\nstill; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a\nheadache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained\nalone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were\nbetter, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs\nin the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.\nThe servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar\u2019s\ndoor; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my\ncandle, and seated myself in the window.\n\nThe moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I\nreflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk\nabout the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along\nthe inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its\nemerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a\nconsiderable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;\nthen started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and\nreappeared presently, leading Miss\u2019s pony; and there she was, just\ndismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily\nacross the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the\ncasement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where\nI awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy\nshoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,\nto lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The\nsurprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate\nexclamation, and stood fixed.\n\n\u201cMy dear Miss Catherine,\u201d I began, too vividly impressed by her recent\nkindness to break into a scold, \u201cwhere have you been riding out at this\nhour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where\nhave you been? Speak!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the bottom of the park,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell a tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd nowhere else?\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d was the muttered reply.\n\n\u201cOh, Catherine!\u201d I cried, sorrowfully. \u201cYou know you have been doing\nwrong, or you wouldn\u2019t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That\ndoes grieve me. I\u2019d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a\ndeliberate lie.\u201d\n\nShe sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my\nneck.\n\n\u201cWell, Ellen, I\u2019m so afraid of you being angry,\u201d she said. \u201cPromise not\nto be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.\u201d\n\nWe sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,\nwhatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she\ncommenced\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I\u2019ve never missed going a\nday since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left\nyour room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every\nevening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn\u2019t scold _him_\neither, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally\nstayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to\namuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and\nthen I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there\nwould be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for\nI had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you\nstayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael\nwas refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got\npossession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit\nhim, because he was sick, and couldn\u2019t come to the Grange; and how papa\nwould object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the\npony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get\nmarried; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,\nto do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that\nsatisfied him better.\n\n\u201cOn my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that\nis their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us\nthat, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was\noff with his dogs\u2014robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard\nafterwards\u2014we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and\ngingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in\nthe arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,\nand we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we\nplanned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn\u2019t\nrepeat that, because you would call it silly.\n\n\u201cOne time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest\nmanner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening\non a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming\ndreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,\nand the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That\nwas his most perfect idea of heaven\u2019s happiness: mine was rocking in a\nrustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds\nflitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and\nblackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,\nand the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but\nclose by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;\nand woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with\njoy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to\nsparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be\nonly half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall\nasleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to\ngrow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the\nright weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.\n\n\u201cAfter sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its\nsmooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,\nif we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help\nus, and we\u2019d have a game at blindman\u2019s-buff; she should try to catch\nus: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn\u2019t: there was no pleasure in\nit, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in\na cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores\nand shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have\nthe C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for\nHeathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn\u2019t\nlike it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,\nand returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his\ngood humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs\u2014_your_\nsongs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me\nto come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying\nhome as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,\ndarling cousin, till morning.\n\n\u201cOn the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly\nthat I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was\nbeautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I\nshall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what\ndelights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and\nwas turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took\nmy bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny\u2019s\nneck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me\nto speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it\nwould kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, \u2018It wouldn\u2019t do mitch\nhurt if it did;\u2019 and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half\ninclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,\nas he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and\nsaid, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: \u2018Miss\nCatherine! I can read yon, now.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Wonderful,\u2019 I exclaimed. \u2018Pray let us hear you\u2014you _are_ grown\nclever!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name\u2014\u2018Hareton Earnshaw.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And the figures?\u2019 I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to\na dead halt.\n\n\u201c\u2018I cannot tell them yet,\u2019 he answered.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, you dunce!\u2019 I said, laughing heartily at his failure.\n\n\u201cThe fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl\ngathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in\nmy mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really\nwas, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity\nand desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He\nreddened\u2014I saw that by the moonlight\u2014dropped his hand from the latch,\nand skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to\nbe as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own\nname; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn\u2019t think the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop, Miss Catherine, dear!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI shall not scold, but I\ndon\u2019t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was\nyour cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how\nimproper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy\nambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and\nprobably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed\nof his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it\nand please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad\nbreeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be\nless rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;\nand I\u2019m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base\nHeathcliff has treated him so unjustly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ellen, you won\u2019t cry about it, will you?\u201d she exclaimed,\nsurprised at my earnestness. \u201cBut wait, and you shall hear if he conned\nhis A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the\nbrute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to\nwelcome me.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m ill to-night, Catherine, love,\u2019 he said; \u2018and you must have all\nthe talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you\nwouldn\u2019t break your word, and I\u2019ll make you promise again, before you\ngo.\u2019\n\n\u201cI knew now that I mustn\u2019t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly\nand put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had\nbrought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little\nof one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:\nhaving gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized\nLinton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.\n\n\u201c\u2018Get to thy own room!\u2019 he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with\npassion; and his face looked swelled and furious. \u2018Take her there if\nshe comes to see thee: thou shalln\u2019t keep me out of this. Begone wi\u2019 ye\nboth!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him\ninto the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly\nlonging to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one\nvolume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a\nmalignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious\nJoseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.\n\n\u201c\u2018I wer sure he\u2019d sarve ye out! He\u2019s a grand lad! He\u2019s getten t\u2019 raight\nsperrit in him! _He_ knaws\u2014ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t\u2019\nmaister yonder\u2014Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech,\nech!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Where must we go?\u2019 I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old\nwretch\u2019s mockery.\n\n\u201cLinton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!\nhe looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into\nan expression of frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the\ndoor, and shook it: it was fastened inside.\n\n\u201c\u2018If you don\u2019t let me in, I\u2019ll kill you!\u2014If you don\u2019t let me in, I\u2019ll\nkill you!\u2019 he rather shrieked than said. \u2018Devil! devil!\u2014I\u2019ll kill\nyou\u2014I\u2019ll kill you!\u2019\n\n\u201cJoseph uttered his croaking laugh again.\n\n\u201c\u2018Thear, that\u2019s t\u2019 father!\u2019 he cried. \u2018That\u2019s father! We\u2019ve allas\nsummut o\u2019 either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad\u2014dunnut be\n\u2019feard\u2014he cannot get at thee!\u2019\n\n\u201cI took hold of Linton\u2019s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he\nshrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were\nchoked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and\nhe fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and\ncalled for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was\nmilking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work,\nshe inquired what there was to do? I hadn\u2019t breath to explain; dragging\nher in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the\nmischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing\nupstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top\nof the steps, and said I shouldn\u2019t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed\nthat he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door,\nand declared I should do \u2018no sich stuff,\u2019 and asked me whether I were\n\u2018bahn to be as mad as him.\u2019 I stood crying till the housekeeper\nreappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn\u2019t\ndo with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me\ninto the house.\n\n\u201cEllen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so\nthat my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy\nwith stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me \u2018wisht,\u2019\nand denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my\nassertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison\nand hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide\nhis cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length\nthey compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the\npremises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and\nchecked Minny and took hold of me.\n\n\u201c\u2018Miss Catherine, I\u2019m ill grieved,\u2019 he began, \u2018but it\u2019s rayther too\nbad\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201cI gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He\nlet go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more\nthan half out of my senses.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn\u2019t go to Wuthering\nHeights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely\nexcited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and\nsometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the\nthird day I took courage: at least, I couldn\u2019t bear longer suspense,\nand stole off once more. I went at five o\u2019clock, and walked; fancying I\nmight manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton\u2019s room,\nunobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah\nreceived me, and saying \u2018the lad was mending nicely,\u2019 showed me into a\nsmall, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I\nbeheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he\nwould neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen:\nhe has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he\ndid open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned\nthe uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except\npassionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a\nfaint \u2018Catherine!\u2019 He did not reckon on being answered so: but I\nwouldn\u2019t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed\nat home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so\nmiserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about\nhim, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.\nIt _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong\nto refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said \u2018Yes,\u2019\nand considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was\nforced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use\ntrying to conceal my presence.\n\n\u201c\u2018Young master is in the house,\u2019 said Zillah, as she saw me making for\nthe parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the\nroom directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking\nup to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be\ntrue\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018As you don\u2019t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to\nhurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last\nmeeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no\nwish to see me, and that he mustn\u2019t invent any more falsehoods on the\nsubject.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You are so\nmuch happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my\ndefects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should\ndoubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he\ncalls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate\neverybody! I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit,\nalmost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you\u2019ll get\nrid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that\nif I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would\nbe; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And\nbelieve that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I\ndeserved your love: and though I couldn\u2019t, and cannot help showing my\nnature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent\nit till I die!\u2019\n\n\u201cI felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though\nwe should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were\nreconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not\nentirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted\nnature. He\u2019ll never let his friends be at ease, and he\u2019ll never be at\nease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that\nnight; because his father returned the day after.\n\n\u201cAbout three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were\nthe first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now\nwith his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I\u2019ve\nlearned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the\nlatter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at\nall. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him\nabusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I\ncan\u2019t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly\nbehaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and\nI interrupted Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s lecture by entering and telling him so.\nHe burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that\nview of the matter. Since then, I\u2019ve told Linton he must whisper his\nbitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can\u2019t be prevented\nfrom going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two\npeople; whereas, if you\u2019ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb\nthe tranquillity of none. You\u2019ll not tell, will you? It will be very\nheartless, if you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,\u201d I\nreplied. \u201cIt requires some study; and so I\u2019ll leave you to your rest,\nand go think it over.\u201d\n\nI thought it over aloud, in my master\u2019s presence; walking straight from\nher room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of\nher conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr.\nLinton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to\nme. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and\nshe learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept\nand writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity\non Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write\nand give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but\nexplaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering\nHeights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew\u2019s disposition and\nstate of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight\nconsolation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n\u201cThese things happened last winter, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Dean; \u201chardly more\nthan a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve\nmonths\u2019 end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating\nthem! Yet, who knows how long you\u2019ll be a stranger? You\u2019re too young to\nrest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one\ncould see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but why do you\nlook so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you\nasked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cStop, my good friend!\u201d I cried. \u201cIt may be very possible that _I_\nshould love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture\nmy tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not\nhere. I\u2019m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was\nCatherine obedient to her father\u2019s commands?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was,\u201d continued the housekeeper. \u201cHer affection for him was still\nthe chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke\nin the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils\nand foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he\ncould bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, \u2018I\nwish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what\nyou think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect\nof improvement, as he grows a man?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s very delicate, sir,\u2019 I replied; \u2018and scarcely likely to reach\nmanhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if\nMiss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond\nher control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.\nHowever, master, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him\nand see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his\nbeing of age.\u2019\u201d\n\nEdgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton\nKirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and\nwe could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the\nsparely-scattered gravestones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve prayed often,\u201d he half soliloquised, \u201cfor the approach of what is\ncoming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of\nthe hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than\nthe anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks,\nto be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I\u2019ve been very\nhappy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she\nwas a living hope at my side. But I\u2019ve been as happy musing by myself\namong those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June\nevenings, on the green mound of her mother\u2019s grave, and\nwishing\u2014yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I\ndo for Cathy? How must I quit her? I\u2019d not care one moment for Linton\nbeing Heathcliff\u2019s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could\nconsole her for my loss. I\u2019d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends,\nand triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be\nunworthy\u2014only a feeble tool to his father\u2014I cannot abandon her to him!\nAnd, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in\nmaking her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.\nDarling! I\u2019d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cResign her to God as it is, sir,\u201d I answered, \u201cand if we should lose\nyou\u2014which may He forbid\u2014under His providence, I\u2019ll stand her friend and\ncounsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don\u2019t fear\nthat she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are\nalways finally rewarded.\u201d\n\nSpring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he\nresumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her\ninexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and\nthen his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt\nsure of his recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit\nthe churchyard: it was raining, and I observed\u2014\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll surely not go out to-night, sir?\u201d\n\nHe answered,\u2014\u201cNo, I\u2019ll defer it this year a little longer.\u201d\n\nHe wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and,\nhad the invalid been presentable, I\u2019ve no doubt his father would have\npermitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an\nanswer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the\nGrange; but his uncle\u2019s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to\nmeet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his\ncousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.\n\nThat part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff\nknew he could plead eloquently for Catherine\u2019s company, then.\n\n\u201cI do not ask,\u201d he said, \u201cthat she may visit here; but am I never to\nsee her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid\nher to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the\nHeights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have\ndone nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me:\nyou have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send\nme a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,\nexcept at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you\nthat my father\u2019s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your\nnephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy\nof Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.\nYou inquire after my health\u2014it is better; but while I remain cut off\nfrom all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who\nnever did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?\u201d\n\nEdgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his\nrequest; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer,\nperhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing\nat intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was\nable by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.\nLinton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have\nspoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:\nbut his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on\nevery line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his\npeculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly\nuppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being\nheld asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.\nLinton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely\ndeceiving him with empty promises.\n\nCathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length\npersuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk\ntogether about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors\nnearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had\nset aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady\u2019s fortune,\nhe had a natural desire that she might retain\u2014or at least return in a\nshort time to\u2014the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only\nprospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea\nthat the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,\nI believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master\nHeathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,\nbegan to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually\nrallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed\nso earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father\ntreating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards\nlearned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:\nhis efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling\nplans were threatened with defeat by death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSummer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his\nassent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first\nride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of\nsunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our\nplace of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.\nOn arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a\nmessenger, told us that,\u2014\u201cMaister Linton wer just o\u2019 this side th\u2019\nHeights: and he\u2019d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,\u201d I\nobserved: \u201che bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at\nonce.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll turn our horses\u2019 heads round when we reach him,\u201d answered\nmy companion; \u201cour excursion shall lie towards home.\u201d\n\nBut when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from\nhis own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,\nand leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,\nand did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so\nfeebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,\u2014\u201cWhy, Master\nHeathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill\nyou do look!\u201d\n\nCatherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the\nejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation\non their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were\nworse than usual?\n\n\u201cNo\u2014better\u2014better!\u201d he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if\nhe needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over\nher; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the\nlanguid expression they once possessed.\n\n\u201cBut you have been worse,\u201d persisted his cousin; \u201cworse than when I saw\nyou last; you are thinner, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he interrupted, hurriedly. \u201cIt is too hot for walking, let\nus rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick\u2014papa says I grow\nso fast.\u201d\n\nBadly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.\n\n\u201cThis is something like your paradise,\u201d said she, making an effort at\ncheerfulness. \u201cYou recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the\nplace and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only\nthere are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer\nthan sunshine. Next week, if you can, we\u2019ll ride down to the Grange\nPark, and try mine.\u201d\n\nLinton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had\nevidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His\nlack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity\nto contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\nconceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his\nwhole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into\nfondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the\npeevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be\nsoothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed\ninvalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured\nmirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,\nthat he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure\nour company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to\ndepart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,\nand threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully\ntowards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at\nleast.\n\n\u201cBut I think,\u201d said Cathy, \u201cyou\u2019d be more comfortable at home than\nsitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\nsongs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;\nyou have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse\nyou, I\u2019d willingly stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay to rest yourself,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd, Catherine, don\u2019t think or\nsay that I\u2019m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make\nme dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell\nuncle I\u2019m in tolerable health, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn\u2019t affirm that you\nare,\u201d observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion\nof what was evidently an untruth.\n\n\u201cAnd be here again next Thursday,\u201d continued he, shunning her puzzled\ngaze. \u201cAnd give him my thanks for permitting you to come\u2014my best\nthanks, Catherine. And\u2014and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\nyou about me, don\u2019t lead him to suppose that I\u2019ve been extremely silent\nand stupid: don\u2019t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing\u2014he\u2019ll be\nangry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI care nothing for his anger,\u201d exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\nits object.\n\n\u201cBut I do,\u201d said her cousin, shuddering. \u201c_Don\u2019t_ provoke him against\nme, Catherine, for he is very hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?\u201d I inquired. \u201cHas he grown\nweary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?\u201d\n\nLinton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\nhis side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on\nhis breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of\nexhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for\nbilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did\nnot offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and\nannoy.\n\n\u201cIs it half-an-hour now, Ellen?\u201d she whispered in my ear, at last. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t tell why we should stay. He\u2019s asleep, and papa will be wanting us\nback.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we must not leave him asleep,\u201d I answered; \u201cwait till he wakes,\nand be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\nsee poor Linton has soon evaporated!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did _he_ wish to see me?\u201d returned Catherine. \u201cIn his crossest\nhumours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\nmood. It\u2019s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform\u2014this\ninterview\u2014for fear his father should scold him. But I\u2019m hardly going to\ncome to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\nordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I\u2019m glad he\u2019s\nbetter in health, I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s so much less pleasant, and so much\nless affectionate to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think _he is_ better in health, then?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered; \u201cbecause he always made such a great deal of his\nsufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\npapa; but he\u2019s better, very likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you differ with me, Miss Cathy,\u201d I remarked; \u201cI should\nconjecture him to be far worse.\u201d\n\nLinton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\nany one had called his name.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Catherine; \u201cunless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you\nmanage to doze out of doors, in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I heard my father,\u201d he gasped, glancing up to the frowning\nnab above us. \u201cYou are sure nobody spoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure,\u201d replied his cousin. \u201cOnly Ellen and I were disputing\nconcerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\nseparated in winter? If you be, I\u2019m certain one thing is not\nstronger\u2014your regard for me: speak,\u2014are you?\u201d\n\nThe tears gushed from Linton\u2019s eyes as he answered, \u201cYes, yes, I am!\u201d\nAnd, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\nand down to detect its owner.\n\nCathy rose. \u201cFor to-day we must part,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t conceal\nthat I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I\u2019ll\nmention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.\nHeathcliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush,\u201d murmured Linton; \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, hush! He\u2019s coming.\u201d And he\nclung to Catherine\u2019s arm, striving to detain her; but at that\nannouncement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\nobeyed her like a dog.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here next Thursday,\u201d she cried, springing to the saddle.\n\u201cGood-bye. Quick, Ellen!\u201d\n\nAnd so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed\nwas he in anticipating his father\u2019s approach.\n\nBefore we reached home, Catherine\u2019s displeasure softened into a\nperplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,\nuneasy doubts about Linton\u2019s actual circumstances, physical and social:\nin which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a\nsecond journey would make us better judges. My master requested an\naccount of our ongoings. His nephew\u2019s offering of thanks was duly\ndelivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little\nlight on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to\nreveal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nSeven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\nrapid alteration of Edgar Linton\u2019s state. The havoc that months had\npreviously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine\nwe would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\ndelude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\nprobability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart\nto mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,\nand obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,\nwhere her father stopped a short time daily\u2014the brief period he could\nbear to sit up\u2014and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged\neach moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by\nhis side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my\nmaster gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a\nhappy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that\nshe would not now be left entirely alone after his death.\n\nHe had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,\nthat, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in\nmind; for Linton\u2019s letters bore few or no indications of his defective\ncharacter. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from\ncorrecting the error; asking myself what good there would be in\ndisturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power\nnor opportunity to turn to account.\n\nWe deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\nAugust: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\nwhoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine\u2019s face was\njust like the landscape\u2014shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\nsuccession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\ntransient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\npassing forgetfulness of its cares.\n\nWe discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.\nMy young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to\nstay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on\nhorseback; but I dissented: I wouldn\u2019t risk losing sight of the charge\ncommitted to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.\nMaster Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:\nnot the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked\nmore like fear.\n\n\u201cIt is late!\u201d he said, speaking short and with difficulty. \u201cIs not your\nfather very ill? I thought you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Why_ won\u2019t you be candid?\u201d cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.\n\u201cWhy cannot you say at once you don\u2019t want me? It is strange, Linton,\nthat for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,\napparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!\u201d\n\nLinton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;\nbut his cousin\u2019s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\nbehaviour.\n\n\u201cMy father _is_ very ill,\u201d she said; \u201cand why am I called from his\nbedside? Why didn\u2019t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\nwished I wouldn\u2019t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and\ntrifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can\u2019t dance\nattendance on your affectations now!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy affectations!\u201d he murmured; \u201cwhat are they? For heaven\u2019s sake,\nCatherine, don\u2019t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am\na worthless, cowardly wretch: I can\u2019t be scorned enough; but I\u2019m too\nmean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d cried Catherine in a passion. \u201cFoolish, silly boy! And\nthere! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn\u2019t\nbespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\nservice. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\nthe hearth-stone, and pretending\u2014what do we pretend? Let go my frock!\nIf I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\nspurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,\nand don\u2019t degrade yourself into an abject reptile\u2014_don\u2019t_!\u201d\n\nWith streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\nnerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\nterror.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he sobbed, \u201cI cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I\u2019m a\ntraitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be\nkilled! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said\nyou loved me, and if you did, it wouldn\u2019t harm you. You\u2019ll not go,\nthen? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent\u2014and\nhe\u2019ll let me die with you!\u201d\n\nMy young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.\nThe old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\ngrew thoroughly moved and alarmed.\n\n\u201cConsent to what?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo stay! tell me the meaning of this\nstrange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract\nme! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\nheart. You wouldn\u2019t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn\u2019t let any\nenemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I\u2019ll believe you are a coward,\nfor yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my father threatened me,\u201d gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\nfingers, \u201cand I dread him\u2014I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well!\u201d said Catherine, with scornful compassion, \u201ckeep your\nsecret: _I\u2019m_ no coward. Save yourself: I\u2019m not afraid!\u201d\n\nHer magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\nsupporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was\ncogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\nnever suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\nhearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\nalmost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn\u2019t cast a glance\ntowards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton\u2019s\nsobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\nto none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn\u2019t avoid doubting,\nhe said\u2014\n\n\u201cIt is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at\nthe Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,\u201d he added, in a lower tone,\n\u201cthat Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\nillness?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; my master is dying,\u201d I replied: \u201cit is true enough. A sad thing it\nwill be for us all, but a blessing for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long will he last, do you think?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he continued, looking at the two young people, who were\nfixed under his eye\u2014Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir\nor raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his\naccount\u2014\u201cbecause that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I\u2019d\nthank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp\nbeen playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about\nsnivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?\u201d\n\n\u201cLively? no\u2014he has shown the greatest distress,\u201d I answered. \u201cTo see\nhim, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\nhills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shall be, in a day or two,\u201d muttered Heathcliff. \u201cBut first\u2014get up,\nLinton! Get up!\u201d he shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t grovel on the ground there: up,\nthis moment!\u201d\n\nLinton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\ncaused by his father\u2019s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\nelse to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but\nhis little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back\nagain with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean\nagainst a ridge of turf.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, with curbed ferocity, \u201cI\u2019m getting angry\u2014and if you\ndon\u2019t command that paltry spirit of yours\u2014_damn_ you! get up directly!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, father,\u201d he panted. \u201cOnly, let me alone, or I shall faint.\nI\u2019ve done as you wished, I\u2019m sure. Catherine will tell you that I\u2014that\nI\u2014have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake mine,\u201d said his father; \u201cstand on your feet. There now\u2014she\u2019ll\nlend you her arm: that\u2019s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was\nthe devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to\nwalk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLinton dear!\u201d whispered Catherine, \u201cI can\u2019t go to Wuthering Heights:\npapa has forbidden me. He\u2019ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can never re-enter that house,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m _not_ to re-enter\nit without you!\u201d\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d cried his father. \u201cWe\u2019ll respect Catherine\u2019s filial scruples.\nNelly, take him in, and I\u2019ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\nwithout delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do well,\u201d replied I. \u201cBut I must remain with my mistress: to\nmind your son is not my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very stiff,\u201d said Heathcliff, \u201cI know that: but you\u2019ll force\nme to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.\nCome, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?\u201d\n\nHe approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile\nbeing; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored\nher to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no\ndenial. However I disapproved, I couldn\u2019t hinder her: indeed, how could\nshe have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no\nmeans of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and\nany addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the\nthreshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had\nconducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when\nMr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed\u2014\u201cMy house is not stricken\nwith the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit\ndown, and allow me to shut the door.\u201d\n\nHe shut and locked it also. I started.\n\n\u201cYou shall have tea before you go home,\u201d he added. \u201cI am by myself.\nHareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\noff on a journey of pleasure; and, though I\u2019m used to being alone, I\u2019d\nrather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,\ntake your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly\nworth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I\nmean. How she does stare! It\u2019s odd what a savage feeling I have to\nanything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less\nstrict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow\nvivisection of those two, as an evening\u2019s amusement.\u201d\n\nHe drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, \u201cBy\nhell! I hate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of you!\u201d exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\nlatter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes\nflashing with passion and resolution. \u201cGive me that key: I will have\nit!\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat or drink here, if I were starving.\u201d\n\nHeathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He\nlooked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,\npossibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom\nshe inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in\ngetting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to\nthe present; he recovered it speedily.\n\n\u201cNow, Catherine Linton,\u201d he said, \u201cstand off, or I shall knock you\ndown; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.\u201d\n\nRegardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its\ncontents again. \u201cWe _will_ go!\u201d she repeated, exerting her utmost\nefforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails\nmade no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff\nglanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.\nCatherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened\nthem suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had\nwell secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling\nher on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps\non both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his\nthreat, had she been able to fall.\n\nAt this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. \u201cYou villain!\u201d I\nbegan to cry, \u201cyou villain!\u201d A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\nstout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\nstaggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\nblood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\nput her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\nsure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor\nthing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.\n\n\u201cI know how to chastise children, you see,\u201d said the scoundrel, grimly,\nas he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\nfloor. \u201cGo to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall\nbe your father, to-morrow\u2014all the father you\u2019ll have in a few days\u2014and\nyou shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you\u2019re no weakling:\nyou shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in\nyour eyes again!\u201d\n\nCathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\ncheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\nthe settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,\nthat the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,\nperceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\nhimself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and\nhanded me a cup.\n\n\u201cWash away your spleen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd help your own naughty pet and\nmine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I\u2019m going out to seek\nyour horses.\u201d\n\nOur first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We\ntried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\nwindows\u2014they were too narrow for even Cathy\u2019s little figure.\n\n\u201cMaster Linton,\u201d I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, \u201cyou\nknow what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or\nI\u2019ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Linton, you must tell,\u201d said Catherine. \u201cIt was for your sake I\ncame; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me some tea, I\u2019m thirsty, and then I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cMrs. Dean, go away. I don\u2019t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,\nyou are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won\u2019t drink that. Give\nme another.\u201d\n\nCatherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted\nat the little wretch\u2019s composure, since he was no longer in terror for\nhimself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as\never he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced\nwith an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;\nand, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.\n\n\u201cPapa wants us to be married,\u201d he continued, after sipping some of the\nliquid. \u201cAnd he knows your papa wouldn\u2019t let us marry now; and he\u2019s\nafraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\nand you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\nshall return home next day, and take me with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake you with her, pitiful changeling!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201c_You_ marry?\nWhy, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you\nimagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie\nherself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the\nnotion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you\nfor a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with\nyour dastardly puling tricks: and\u2014don\u2019t look so silly, now! I\u2019ve a very\ngood mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and\nyour imbecile conceit.\u201d\n\nI did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he\ntook to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine\nrebuked me.\n\n\u201cStay all night? No,\u201d she said, looking slowly round. \u201cEllen, I\u2019ll burn\nthat door down but I\u2019ll get out.\u201d\n\nAnd she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\nLinton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his\ntwo feeble arms sobbing:\u2014\u201cWon\u2019t you have me, and save me? not let me\ncome to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn\u2019t go and leave,\nafter all. You _must_ obey my father\u2014you _must_!\u201d\n\n\u201cI must obey my own,\u201d she replied, \u201cand relieve him from this cruel\nsuspense. The whole night! What would he think? He\u2019ll be distressed\nalready. I\u2019ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!\nYou\u2019re in no danger; but if you hinder me\u2014Linton, I love papa better\nthan you!\u201d\n\nThe mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s anger restored to the boy\nhis coward\u2019s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she\npersisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\npersuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus\noccupied, our jailor re-entered.\n\n\u201cYour beasts have trotted off,\u201d he said, \u201cand\u2014now Linton! snivelling\nagain? What has she been doing to you? Come, come\u2014have done, and get to\nbed. In a month or two, my lad, you\u2019ll be able to pay her back her\npresent tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You\u2019re pining for pure love,\nare you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,\nto bed! Zillah won\u2019t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!\nhold your noise! Once in your own room, I\u2019ll not come near you: you\nneedn\u2019t fear. By chance, you\u2019ve managed tolerably. I\u2019ll look to the\nrest.\u201d\n\nHe spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and\nthe latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected\nthe person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock\nwas re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\nstood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\nher cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else\nwould have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\nbut he scowled on her and muttered\u2014\u201cOh! you are not afraid of me? Your\ncourage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!\u201d\n\n\u201cI _am_ afraid now,\u201d she replied, \u201cbecause, if I stay, papa will be\nmiserable: and how can I endure making him miserable\u2014when he\u2014when\nhe\u2014Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa\nwould like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do\nwhat I\u2019ll willingly do of myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him dare to force you,\u201d I cried. \u201cThere\u2019s law in the land, thank\nGod! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I\u2019d inform if\nhe were my own son: and it\u2019s felony without benefit of clergy!\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d said the ruffian. \u201cTo the devil with your clamour! I don\u2019t\nwant _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\nthinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\nsatisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\nresidence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing\nme that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,\nI\u2019ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place\ntill it is fulfilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend Ellen, then, to let papa know I\u2019m safe!\u201d exclaimed Catherine,\nweeping bitterly. \u201cOr marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he\u2019ll think we\u2019re\nlost. What shall we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot he! He\u2019ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\nlittle amusement,\u201d answered Heathcliff. \u201cYou cannot deny that you\nentered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\nthe contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\nat your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that\nman _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when\nyour days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world\n(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went\nout of it. I\u2019d join him. I don\u2019t love you! How should I? Weep away. As\nfar as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless\nLinton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears\nto fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me\nvastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and\nkind to her when he got her. Careful and kind\u2014that\u2019s paternal. But\nLinton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.\nLinton can play the little tyrant well. He\u2019ll undertake to torture any\nnumber of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You\u2019ll\nbe able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get\nhome again, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right there!\u201d I said; \u201cexplain your son\u2019s character. Show his\nresemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\nbefore she takes the cockatrice!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,\u201d he answered;\n\u201cbecause she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\nwith her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite\nconcealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and\nyou\u2019ll have an opportunity of judging!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not retract my word,\u201d said Catherine. \u201cI\u2019ll marry him within this\nhour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,\nyou\u2019re a cruel man, but you\u2019re not a fiend; and you won\u2019t, from _mere_\nmalice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had\nleft him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to\nlive? I\u2019ve given over crying: but I\u2019m going to kneel here, at your\nknee; and I\u2019ll not get up, and I\u2019ll not take my eyes from your face\ntill you look back at me! No, don\u2019t turn away! _do_ look! you\u2019ll see\nnothing to provoke you. I don\u2019t hate you. I\u2019m not angry that you struck\nme. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?\nAh! you must look once. I\u2019m so wretched, you can\u2019t help being sorry and\npitying me.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your eft\u2019s fingers off; and move, or I\u2019ll kick you!\u201d cried\nHeathcliff, brutally repulsing her. \u201cI\u2019d rather be hugged by a snake.\nHow the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!\u201d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\nwith aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\nmouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered\ndumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be\nshown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was\ngrowing dark\u2014we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host\nhurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There\nwas a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.\n\n\u201cI thought it had been your cousin Hareton,\u201d I observed to Catherine.\n\u201cI wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,\u201d said\nHeathcliff, overhearing me. \u201cYou should have opened a lattice and\ncalled out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn\u2019t. She\u2019s glad\nto be obliged to stay, I\u2019m certain.\u201d\n\nAt learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\nwithout control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o\u2019clock. Then\nhe bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah\u2019s chamber; and I\nwhispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get\nthrough the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.\nThe window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap\nwas safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We\nneither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and\nwatched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I\ncould obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I\nseated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment\non my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the\nmisfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I\nam aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I\nthought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.\n\nAt seven o\u2019clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She\nran to the door immediately, and answered, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHere, then,\u201d he\nsaid, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned\nthe lock again. I demanded my release.\n\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d he replied; \u201cI\u2019ll send up your breakfast in a while.\u201d\n\nI thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine\nasked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it\nanother hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at\nlength, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought you something to eat,\u201d said a voice; \u201coppen t\u2019 door!\u201d\n\nComplying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\nall day.\n\n\u201cTak\u2019 it,\u201d he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.\n\n\u201cStay one minute,\u201d I began.\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\nforth to detain him.\n\nAnd there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\nnight; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,\naltogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\nmodel of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\nhis sense of justice or compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nOn the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\napproached\u2014lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\nroom. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\nbonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.\n\n\u201cEh, dear! Mrs. Dean!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWell! there is a talk about you\nat Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse\nmarsh, and missy with you, till master told me you\u2019d been found, and\nhe\u2019d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?\nAnd how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But\nyou\u2019re not so thin\u2014you\u2019ve not been so poorly, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour master is a true scoundrel!\u201d I replied. \u201cBut he shall answer for\nit. He needn\u2019t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Zillah. \u201cIt\u2019s not his tale: they tell that in\nthe village\u2014about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to\nEarnshaw, when I come in\u2014\u2018Eh, they\u2019s queer things, Mr. Hareton,\nhappened since I went off. It\u2019s a sad pity of that likely young lass,\nand cant Nelly Dean.\u2019 He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I\ntold him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to\nhimself, and said, \u2018If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,\nZillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can\ntell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got\ninto her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed\nher till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange\nat once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young\nlady will follow in time to attend the squire\u2019s funeral.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Edgar is not dead?\u201d I gasped. \u201cOh! Zillah, Zillah!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no; sit you down, my good mistress,\u201d she replied; \u201cyou\u2019re right\nsickly yet. He\u2019s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\nday. I met him on the road and asked.\u201d\n\nInstead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\nbelow, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for\nsome one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with\nsunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I\nhesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\nslight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,\nsole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\nwith apathetic eyes. \u201cWhere is Miss Catherine?\u201d I demanded sternly,\nsupposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching\nhim thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.\n\n\u201cIs she gone?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied; \u201cshe\u2019s upstairs: she\u2019s not to go; we won\u2019t let her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t let her, little idiot!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDirect me to her room\nimmediately, or I\u2019ll make you sing out sharply.\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,\u201d he\nanswered. \u201cHe says I\u2019m not to be soft with Catherine: she\u2019s my wife,\nand it\u2019s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates\nme and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan\u2019t have\nit: and she shan\u2019t go home! She never shall!\u2014she may cry, and be sick\nas much as she pleases!\u201d\n\nHe resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to\ndrop asleep.\n\n\u201cMaster Heathcliff,\u201d I resumed, \u201chave you forgotten all Catherine\u2019s\nkindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\nshe brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\nwind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you\nwould be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times\ntoo good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though\nyou know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That\u2019s fine\ngratitude, is it not?\u201d\n\nThe corner of Linton\u2019s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\nlips.\n\n\u201cDid she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?\u201d I continued.\n\u201cThink for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you\nwill have any. And you say she\u2019s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\nthere in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so\nneglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,\ntoo; but you won\u2019t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you\nsee\u2014an elderly woman, and a servant merely\u2014and you, after pretending\nsuch affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every\ntear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you\u2019re a\nheartless, selfish boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay with her,\u201d he answered crossly. \u201cI\u2019ll not stay by myself.\nShe cries so I can\u2019t bear it. And she won\u2019t give over, though I say\nI\u2019ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle\nher if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the\nroom, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for\nvexation that I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Mr. Heathcliff out?\u201d I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\ncreature had no power to sympathise with his cousin\u2019s mental tortures.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the court,\u201d he replied, \u201ctalking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\nuncle is dying, truly, at last. I\u2019m glad, for I shall be master of the\nGrange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn\u2019t\nhers! It\u2019s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice\nbooks are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\nher pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;\nbut I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And\nthen she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I\nshould have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,\nand on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday\u2014I said\n_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful\nthing wouldn\u2019t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked\nout\u2014that frightens her\u2014she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges\nand divided the case, and gave me her mother\u2019s portrait; the other she\nattempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\nit. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\nshe refused, and he\u2014he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\nand crushed it with his foot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd were you pleased to see her struck?\u201d I asked: having my designs in\nencouraging his talk.\n\n\u201cI winked,\u201d he answered: \u201cI wink to see my father strike a dog or a\nhorse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first\u2014she deserved\npunishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to\nthe window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her\nteeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the\nbits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,\nand she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can\u2019t\nspeak for pain. I don\u2019t like to think so; but she\u2019s a naughty thing for\ncrying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I\u2019m afraid of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can get the key if you choose?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, when I am upstairs,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut I can\u2019t walk upstairs\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what apartment is it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he cried, \u201cI shan\u2019t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.\nNobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you\u2019ve tired\nme\u2014go away, go away!\u201d And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\nhis eyes again.\n\nI considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring\na rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the\nastonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\nintense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two\nor three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar\u2019s door:\nbut I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,\neven in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation\nawaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was\nthirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He\nthought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and\nspoke.\n\n\u201cCatherine is coming, dear master!\u201d I whispered; \u201cshe is alive and\nwell; and will be here, I hope, to-night.\u201d\n\nI trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\nlooked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As\nsoon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\nthe Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\ntrue. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I\ndescribe all his father\u2019s brutal conduct\u2014my intentions being to add no\nbitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.\n\nHe divined that one of his enemy\u2019s purposes was to secure the personal\nproperty, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\nhe did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\nignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.\nHowever, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of\nleaving Catherine\u2019s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put\nit in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her\nchildren, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall\nto Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.\n\nHaving received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,\nand four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young\nlady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single\nservant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he\narrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;\nand then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village\nthat must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before\nmorning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word\nthat Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would\nnot suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for\nlistening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving\nto take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it\nliterally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her\nfather _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be\nkilled on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!\n\nHappily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone\ndownstairs at three o\u2019clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\nthrough the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front\ndoor made me jump. \u201cOh! it is Green,\u201d I said, recollecting myself\u2014\u201conly\nGreen,\u201d and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\nthe knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the\njug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon\nshone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little\nmistress sprang on my neck sobbing, \u201cEllen, Ellen! Is papa alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I cried: \u201cyes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe\nwith us again!\u201d\n\nShe wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton\u2019s\nroom; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,\nand washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.\nThen I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to\nsay, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon\ncomprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured\nme she would not complain.\n\nI couldn\u2019t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the\nchamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\nthen. All was composed, however: Catherine\u2019s despair was as silent as\nher father\u2019s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\non her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.\n\nHe died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he\nmurmured,\u2014\u201cI am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to\nus!\u201d and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant\ngaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None\ncould have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely\nwithout a struggle.\n\nWhether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\nweighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\nsat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that\ndeathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It\nwas well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the\nlawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how\nto behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of\nhis delay in obeying my master\u2019s summons. Fortunately, no thought of\nworldly affairs crossed the latter\u2019s mind, to disturb him, after his\ndaughter\u2019s arrival.\n\nMr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\nplace. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have\ncarried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\nLinton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with\nhis family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\nprotestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral\nwas hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered\nto stay at the Grange till her father\u2019s corpse had quitted it.\n\nShe told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the\nrisk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,\nand she gathered the sense of Heathcliff\u2019s answer. It drove her\ndesperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon\nafter I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father\nre-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without\nshutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep\nwith Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole\nout before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs\nshould raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined\ntheir windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother\u2019s, she got easily\nout of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree\nclose by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,\nnotwithstanding his timid contrivances.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\nlibrary; now musing mournfully\u2014one of us despairingly\u2014on our loss, now\nventuring conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n\nWe had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would\nbe a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during\nLinton\u2019s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as\nhousekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be\nhoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect\nof retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved\nyoung mistress; when a servant\u2014one of the discarded ones, not yet\ndeparted\u2014rushed hastily in, and said \u201cthat devil Heathcliff\u201d was coming\nthrough the court: should he fasten the door in his face?\n\nIf we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He\nmade no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\navailed himself of the master\u2019s privilege to walk straight in, without\nsaying a word. The sound of our informant\u2019s voice directed him to the\nlibrary; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n\nIt was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,\neighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the\nsame autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but\nall the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the\nsplendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.\nHeathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person\neither. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more\ncomposed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other\ndifference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she\nsaw him.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he said, arresting her by the arm. \u201cNo more runnings away!\nWhere would you go? I\u2019m come to fetch you home; and I hope you\u2019ll be a\ndutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I\nwas embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the\nbusiness: he\u2019s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you\u2019ll\nsee by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one\nevening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and\nnever touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room\nto ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and\nsince then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I\nfancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and\nshrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him\nfrom me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must\ncome: he\u2019s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not let Catherine continue here,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cand send Master\nLinton to her? As you hate them both, you\u2019d not miss them: they _can_\nonly be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeking a tenant for the Grange,\u201d he answered; \u201cand I want my\nchildren about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services\nfor her bread. I\u2019m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness\nafter Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don\u2019t oblige\nme to compel you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall,\u201d said Catherine. \u201cLinton is all I have to love in the world,\nand though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and\nme to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt\nhim when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a boastful champion,\u201d replied Heathcliff; \u201cbut I don\u2019t like\nyou well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the\ntorment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to\nyou\u2014it is his own sweet spirit. He\u2019s as bitter as gall at your\ndesertion and its consequences: don\u2019t expect thanks for this noble\ndevotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he\nwould do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his\nvery weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he has a bad nature,\u201d said Catherine: \u201che\u2019s your son. But I\u2019m\nglad I\u2019ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\nreason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;\nand, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\nthinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_\nmiserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n_Nobody_ loves you\u2014_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn\u2019t\nbe you!\u201d\n\nCatherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made\nup her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw\npleasure from the griefs of her enemies.\n\n\u201cYou shall be sorry to be yourself presently,\u201d said her father-in-law,\n\u201cif you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your\nthings!\u201d\n\nShe scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah\u2019s\nplace at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would\nsuffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first\ntime, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the\npictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton\u2019s, he said\u2014\u201cI shall have that\nhome. Not because I need it, but\u2014\u201d He turned abruptly to the fire, and\ncontinued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a\nsmile\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was\ndigging Linton\u2019s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I\nopened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her\nface again\u2014it is hers yet!\u2014he had hard work to stir me; but he said it\nwould change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the\ncoffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton\u2019s side, damn him! I wish\nhe\u2019d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away\nwhen I\u2019m laid there, and slide mine out too; I\u2019ll have it made so: and\nthen by the time Linton gets to us he\u2019ll not know which is which!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!\u201d I exclaimed; \u201cwere you not\nashamed to disturb the dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI disturbed nobody, Nelly,\u201d he replied; \u201cand I gave some ease to\nmyself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you\u2019ll have a\nbetter chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed\nher? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\nyears\u2014incessantly\u2014remorselessly\u2014till yesternight; and yesternight I was\ntranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with\nmy heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you\nhave dreamt of then?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOf dissolving with her, and being more happy still!\u201d he answered. \u201cDo\nyou suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a\ntransformation on raising the lid, but I\u2019m better pleased that it should\nnot commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct\nimpression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would\nhardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she\ndied; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her\nspirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they\ncan, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall\nof snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as\nwinter\u2014all round was solitary. I didn\u2019t fear that her fool of a husband\nwould wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring\nthem there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the\nsole barrier between us, I said to myself\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll have her in my arms\nagain! If she be cold, I\u2019ll think it is this north wind that chills\n_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.\u2019 I got a spade from the\ntool-house, and began to delve with all my might\u2014it scraped the coffin;\nI fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the\nscrews; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that\nI heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and\nbending down. \u2018If I can only get this off,\u2019 I muttered, \u2018I wish they\nmay shovel in the earth over us both!\u2019 and I wrenched at it more\ndesperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared\nto feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew\nno living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you\nperceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it\ncannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not\nunder me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my\nheart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned\nconsoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it\nremained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,\nif you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was\nwith me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the\nHeights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I\nremember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I\nremember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying\nupstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently\u2014I felt her by\nme\u2014I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have\nsweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning\u2014from the fervour of\nmy supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed\nherself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,\nsometimes more and sometimes less, I\u2019ve been the sport of that\nintolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch\nthat, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have\nrelaxed to the feebleness of Linton\u2019s. When I sat in the house with\nHareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked\non the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I\nhastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was\ncertain! And when I slept in her chamber\u2014I was beaten out of that. I\ncouldn\u2019t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\noutside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,\nor even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a\nchild; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them\na hundred times a night\u2014to be always disappointed! It racked me! I\u2019ve\noften groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that\nmy conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I\u2019ve seen\nher, I\u2019m pacified\u2014a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by\ninches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the\nspectre of a hope through eighteen years!\u201d\n\nMr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\nwith perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,\nthe brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the\ngrim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of\ntrouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one\nabsorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.\nI didn\u2019t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his\nmeditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa\nto contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine\nentered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be\nsaddled.\n\n\u201cSend that over to-morrow,\u201d said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\nhe added: \u201cYou may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and\nyou\u2019ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,\nyour own feet will serve you. Come along.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Ellen!\u201d whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,\nher lips felt like ice. \u201cCome and see me, Ellen; don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!\u201d said her new father. \u201cWhen\nI wish to speak to you I\u2019ll come here. I want none of your prying at my\nhouse!\u201d\n\nHe signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my\nheart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the\ngarden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine\u2019s arm under his: though she disputed\nthe act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into\nthe alley, whose trees concealed them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nI have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\nleft: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\nand wouldn\u2019t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was \u201cthrang,\u201d and the\nmaster was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\notherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks\nCatherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My\nyoung lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.\nHeathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his\ndaughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,\nbeing a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child\u2019s\nannoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted\nmy informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some\ngreat wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a\nlittle before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and\nthis is what she told me.\n\n\u201cThe first thing Mrs. Linton did,\u201d she said, \u201con her arrival at the\nHeights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\nand Joseph; she shut herself into Linton\u2019s room, and remained till\nmorning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\nentered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be\nsent for? her cousin was very ill.\n\n\u201c\u2018We know that!\u2019 answered Heathcliff; \u2018but his life is not worth a\nfarthing, and I won\u2019t spend a farthing on him.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But I cannot tell how to do,\u2019 she said; \u2018and if nobody will help me,\nhe\u2019ll die!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Walk out of the room,\u2019 cried the master, \u2018and let me never hear a\nword more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act\nthe nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen she began to bother me, and I said I\u2019d had enough plague with the\ntiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\nMr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n\n\u201cHow they managed together, I can\u2019t tell. I fancy he fretted a great\ndeal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little\nrest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes\ncame into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would\nfain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never\ndare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that\nKenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to\nadvise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,\nafter we had gone to bed, I\u2019ve happened to open my door again and seen\nher sitting crying on the stairs\u2019-top; and then I\u2019ve shut myself in\nquick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I\u2019m\nsure: still I didn\u2019t wish to lose my place, you know.\n\n\u201cAt last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\nout of my wits, by saying, \u2018Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is\ndying\u2014I\u2019m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.\u2019\n\n\u201cHaving uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an\nhour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred\u2014the house was quiet.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s mistaken, I said to myself. He\u2019s got over it. I needn\u2019t disturb\nthem; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a\nsharp ringing of the bell\u2014the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\nLinton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and\ninform them that he wouldn\u2019t have that noise repeated.\n\n\u201cI delivered Catherine\u2019s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few\nminutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I\nfollowed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\nfolded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\nLinton\u2019s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to\nher.\n\n\u201c\u2018Now\u2014Catherine,\u2019 he said, \u2018how do you feel?\u2019\n\n\u201cShe was dumb.\n\n\u201c\u2018How do you feel, Catherine?\u2019 he repeated.\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s safe, and I\u2019m free,\u2019 she answered: \u2018I should feel well\u2014but,\u2019 she\ncontinued, with a bitterness she couldn\u2019t conceal, \u2018you have left me so\nlong to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I\nfeel like death!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and\nJoseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and\nheard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,\nof the lad\u2019s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was\nmore taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But\nthe master bid him get off to bed again: we didn\u2019t want his help. He\nafterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\nreturn to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.\n\n\u201cIn the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to\nbreakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she\nwas ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he\nreplied,\u2014\u2018Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and\nthen to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell\nme.\u2019\u201d\n\nCathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\ntwice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\nat increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n\nHeathcliff went up once, to show her Linton\u2019s will. He had bequeathed\nthe whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\nfather: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act\nduring her week\u2019s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a\nminor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed\nand kept them in his wife\u2019s right and his also: I suppose legally; at\nany rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his\npossession.\n\n\u201cNobody,\u201d said Zillah, \u201cever approached her door, except that once, but\nI; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her\ncoming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried\nout, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn\u2019t bear any longer\nbeing in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross\nGrange, and Earnshaw and I needn\u2019t hinder her from descending; so, as\nsoon as she heard Heathcliff\u2019s horse trot off, she made her appearance,\ndonned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as\nplain as a Quaker: she couldn\u2019t comb them out.\n\n\u201cJoseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:\u201d the kirk, (you know,\nhas no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists\u2019\nor Baptists\u2019 place, I can\u2019t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)\n\u201cJoseph had gone,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut I thought proper to bide at\nhome. Young folks are always the better for an elder\u2019s over-looking;\nand Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn\u2019t a model of nice behaviour.\nI let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she\nhad been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good\nleave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He\ncoloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.\nThe train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw\nhe meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted\nto be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master\nis by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.\nHe grew sullen, and began to swear.\n\n\u201cNow, Mrs. Dean,\u201d Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n\u201cyou happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\nyou\u2019re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\nlower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\nnow? She\u2019s as poor as you or I: poorer, I\u2019ll be bound: you\u2019re saving,\nand I\u2019m doing my little all that road.\u201d\n\nHareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into\na good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former\ninsults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper\u2019s\naccount.\n\n\u201cMissis walked in,\u201d she said, \u201cas chill as an icicle, and as high as a\nprincess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair. No, she\nturned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\nto the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ve been starved a month and more,\u2019 she answered, resting on the\nword as scornful as she could.\n\n\u201cAnd she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\nof us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\ndiscovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\nfeet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her\ncousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\nto help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\ncame to hand.\n\n\u201cThat was a great advance for the lad. She didn\u2019t thank him; still, he\nfelt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\nstand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\nstruck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was\nhe daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his\nfinger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking\nat her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for\nsomething to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in\nthe study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn\u2019t see, and she\ncouldn\u2019t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but\nattracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring\nto touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if\nit were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started\nround in such a taking.\n\n\u201c\u2018Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping\nthere?\u2019 she cried, in a tone of disgust. \u2018I can\u2019t endure you! I\u2019ll go\nupstairs again, if you come near me.\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down\nin the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes\nanother half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.\n\n\u201c\u2018Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I\u2019m stalled of doing naught;\nand I do like\u2014I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask\nof yourseln.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma\u2019am,\u2019 I said, immediately.\n\u2018He\u2019d take it very kind\u2014he\u2019d be much obliged.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe frowned; and looking up, answered\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to\nunderstand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the\nhypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any\nof you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see\none of your faces, you all kept off. But I won\u2019t complain to you! I\u2019m\ndriven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your\nsociety.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What could I ha\u2019 done?\u2019 began Earnshaw. \u2018How was I to blame?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh! you are an exception,\u2019 answered Mrs. Heathcliff. \u2018I never missed\nsuch a concern as you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But I offered more than once, and asked,\u2019 he said, kindling up at her\npertness, \u2018I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Be silent! I\u2019ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your\ndisagreeable voice in my ear!\u2019 said my lady.\n\n\u201cHareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his\ngun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He\ntalked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her\nsolitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was\nforced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took\ncare there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since,\nI\u2019ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us:\nand she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her,\nand she\u2019ll curl back without respect of any one. She\u2019ll snap at the\nmaster himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more\nhurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.\u201d\n\nAt first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my\nsituation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:\nbut Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton\nin an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless\nshe could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my\nprovince to arrange.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nThus ended Mrs. Dean\u2019s story. Notwithstanding the doctor\u2019s prophecy, I\nam rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week\nin January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and\nriding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall\nspend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out\nfor another tenant to take the place after October. I would not pass\nanother winter here for much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nYesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I\nproposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to\nher young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not\nconscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open,\nbut the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and\ninvoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I\nentered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took\nparticular notice of him this time; but then he does his best\napparently to make the least of his advantages.\n\nI asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would\nbe in at dinner-time. It was eleven o\u2019clock, and I announced my\nintention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately\nflung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not\nas a substitute for the host.\n\nWe entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in\npreparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more\nsulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly\nraised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the\nsame disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning\nmy bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.\n\n\u201cShe does not seem so amiable,\u201d I thought, \u201cas Mrs. Dean would persuade\nme to believe. She\u2019s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.\u201d\n\nEarnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. \u201cRemove them\nyourself,\u201d she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\nretiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\nbirds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached\nher, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,\nadroitly dropped Mrs. Dean\u2019s note on to her knee, unnoticed by\nHareton\u2014but she asked aloud, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d And chucked it off.\n\n\u201cA letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,\u201d I\nanswered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\nshould be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered\nit up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it\nin his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.\nThereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very\nstealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her\neyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer\nfeelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,\nas ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;\nthen she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and\nirrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured\nin soliloquy:\n\n\u201cI should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be\nclimbing up there! Oh! I\u2019m tired\u2014I\u2019m _stalled_, Hareton!\u201d And she leant\nher pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\nsigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring\nnor knowing whether we remarked her.\n\n\u201cMrs. Heathcliff,\u201d I said, after sitting some time mute, \u201cyou are not\naware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\nstrange you won\u2019t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of\ntalking about and praising you; and she\u2019ll be greatly disappointed if I\nreturn with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\nand said nothing!\u201d\n\nShe appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,\u2014\n\n\u201cDoes Ellen like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, very well,\u201d I replied, hesitatingly.\n\n\u201cYou must tell her,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat I would answer her letter,\nbut I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might\ntear a leaf.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo books!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow do you contrive to live here without\nthem? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a\nlarge library, I\u2019m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books\naway, and I should be desperate!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always reading, when I had them,\u201d said Catherine; \u201cand Mr.\nHeathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my\nbooks. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched\nthrough Joseph\u2019s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,\nHareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room\u2014some Latin and Greek,\nand some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here\u2014and\nyou gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love\nof stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in\nthe bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.\nPerhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my\ntreasures? But I\u2019ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my\nheart, and you cannot deprive me of those!\u201d\n\nEarnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\nprivate literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of\nher accusations.\n\n\u201cMr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,\u201d I\nsaid, coming to his rescue. \u201cHe is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\nattainments. He\u2019ll be a clever scholar in a few years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,\u201d answered Catherine.\n\u201cYes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty\nblunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did\nyesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning\nover the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing\nbecause you couldn\u2019t read their explanations!\u201d\n\nThe young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\nfor his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a\nsimilar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean\u2019s anecdote of his first\nattempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\nobserved,\u2014\u201cBut, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\neach stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\ninstead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he\nhas no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me\nwith his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose\nand verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to\nhave them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has\nselected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out\nof deliberate malice.\u201d\n\nHareton\u2019s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\nsense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to\nsuppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his\nembarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the\nexternal prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the\nroom; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his\nhands, which he threw into Catherine\u2019s lap, exclaiming,\u2014\u201cTake them! I\nnever want to hear, or read, or think of them again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t have them now,\u201d she answered. \u201cI shall connect them with you,\nand hate them.\u201d\n\nShe opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\nportion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\nfrom her. \u201cAnd listen,\u201d she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\nof an old ballad in the same fashion.\n\nBut his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\naltogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.\nThe little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin\u2019s sensitive\nthough uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode\nhe had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the\ninflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the\nfire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that\nsacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the\npleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing\npleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the\nincitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily\nlabour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.\nShame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters\nto higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning\nhim to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the\ncontrary result.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!\u201d\ncried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the\nconflagration with indignant eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d _better_ hold your tongue, now,\u201d he answered fiercely.\n\nAnd his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\nentrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the\ndoor-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,\nand laying hold of his shoulder asked,\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s to do now, my lad?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaught, naught,\u201d he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger\nin solitude.\n\nHeathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n\n\u201cIt will be odd if I thwart myself,\u201d he muttered, unconscious that I\nwas behind him. \u201cBut when I look for his father in his face, I find\n_her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to\nsee him.\u201d\n\nHe bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a\nrestless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked\nthere before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on\nperceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,\nso that I remained alone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,\u201d he said, in\nreply to my greeting; \u201cfrom selfish motives partly: I don\u2019t think I\ncould readily supply your loss in this desolation. I\u2019ve wondered more\nthan once what brought you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn idle whim, I fear, sir,\u201d was my answer; \u201cor else an idle whim is\ngoing to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I\nmust give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\nGrange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall\nnot live there any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, indeed; you\u2019re tired of being banished from the world, are you?\u201d\nhe said. \u201cBut if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you\nwon\u2019t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my\ndue from any one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to plead off nothing about it,\u201d I exclaimed, considerably\nirritated. \u201cShould you wish it, I\u2019ll settle with you now,\u201d and I drew\nmy note-book from my pocket.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he replied, coolly; \u201cyou\u2019ll leave sufficient behind to cover\nyour debts, if you fail to return: I\u2019m not in such a hurry. Sit down\nand take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his\nvisit can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in:\nwhere are you?\u201d\n\nCatherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.\n\n\u201cYou may get your dinner with Joseph,\u201d muttered Heathcliff, aside, \u201cand\nremain in the kitchen till he is gone.\u201d\n\nShe obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no\ntemptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she\nprobably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets\nthem.\n\nWith Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\nabsolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and\nbade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\nglimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders\nto lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I\ncould not fulfil my wish.\n\n\u201cHow dreary life gets over in that house!\u201d I reflected, while riding\ndown the road. \u201cWhat a realisation of something more romantic than a\nfairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I\nstruck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated\ntogether into the stirring atmosphere of the town!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\n1802.\u2014This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend\nin the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came\nwithin fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside\npublic-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a\ncart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he\nremarked,\u2014\u201cYon\u2019s frough Gimmerton, nah! They\u2019re allas three wick\u2019 after\nother folk wi\u2019 ther harvest.\u201d\n\n\u201cGimmerton?\u201d I repeated\u2014my residence in that locality had already grown\ndim and dreamy. \u201cAh! I know. How far is it from this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHappen fourteen mile o\u2019er th\u2019 hills; and a rough road,\u201d he answered.\n\nA sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely\nnoon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\nroof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\nmatters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\nthe neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\ninquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,\nwe managed the distance in some three hours.\n\nI left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church\nlooked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a\nmoor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm\nweather\u2014too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\nenjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\nAugust, I\u2019m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\nsolitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more\ndivine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells\nof heath.\n\nI reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\nfamily had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,\nblue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I\nrode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat\nknitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a\nmeditative pipe.\n\n\u201cIs Mrs. Dean within?\u201d I demanded of the dame.\n\n\u201cMistress Dean? Nay!\u201d she answered, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t bide here: shoo\u2019s up\nat th\u2019 Heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you the housekeeper, then?\u201d I continued.\n\n\u201cEea, Aw keep th\u2019 hause,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me\nin, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019 maister!\u201d she cried in astonishment. \u201cWhet, whoiver knew yah wur\ncoming? Yah sud ha\u2019 send word. They\u2019s nowt norther dry nor mensful\nabaht t\u2019 place: nowt there isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nShe threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I\nentered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,\nthat I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her\nbe composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to\nprepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to\nsleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were\nnecessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the\nhearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and\nmalappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,\nconfiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.\nWuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An\nafter-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.\n\n\u201cAll well at the Heights?\u201d I inquired of the woman.\n\n\u201cEea, f\u2019r owt ee knaw!\u201d she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\ncinders.\n\nI would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\nimpossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\nexit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\nand the mild glory of a rising moon in front\u2014one fading, and the other\nbrightening\u2014as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\nbranching off to Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight\nof it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the\nwest: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of\ngrass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to\nknock\u2014it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I\nnoticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and\nwallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n\nBoth doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\ncoal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\nthe eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house\nof Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\nfor withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates\nthere were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I\ncould both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\nlistened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\ncuriosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n\n\u201cCon-_trary_!\u201d said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. \u201cThat for the\nthird time, you dunce! I\u2019m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\nI\u2019ll pull your hair!\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary, then,\u201d answered another, in deep but softened tones. \u201cAnd\nnow, kiss me, for minding so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.\u201d\n\nThe male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\nand seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features\nglowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\npage to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\nsmart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\ninattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\nblending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to\nsuperintend his studies; and her face\u2014it was lucky he could not see her\nface, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip\nin spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing\nsomething besides staring at its smiting beauty.\n\nThe task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil\nclaimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\ngenerously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their\nconversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on\nthe moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw\u2019s\nheart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions\nif I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and\nfeeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the\nkitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at\nthe door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which\nwas often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and\nintolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rayther, by th\u2019 haulf, hev\u2019 \u2019em swearing i\u2019 my lugs fro\u2019h morn to\nneeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!\u201d said the tenant of the kitchen, in\nanswer to an unheard speech of Nelly\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a blazing shame, that I\ncannot oppen t\u2019 blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,\nand all t\u2019 flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th\u2019 warld!\nOh! ye\u2019re a raight nowt; and shoo\u2019s another; and that poor lad \u2019ll be\nlost atween ye. Poor lad!\u201d he added, with a groan; \u201che\u2019s witched: I\u2019m\nsartin on\u2019t. Oh, Lord, judge \u2019em, for there\u2019s norther law nor justice\namong wer rullers!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,\u201d retorted\nthe singer. \u201cBut wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,\nand never mind me. This is \u2018Fairy Annie\u2019s Wedding\u2019\u2014a bonny tune\u2014it goes\nto a dance.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\ndirectly, she jumped to her feet, crying\u2014\u201cWhy, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!\nHow could you think of returning in this way? All\u2019s shut up at\nThrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,\u201d\nI answered. \u201cI depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted\nhere, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cZillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\nto London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you\nwalked from Gimmerton this evening?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the Grange,\u201d I replied; \u201cand while they make me lodging room\nthere, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don\u2019t\nthink of having another opportunity in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat business, sir?\u201d said Nelly, conducting me into the house. \u201cHe\u2019s\ngone out at present, and won\u2019t return soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the rent,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cOh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,\u201d she observed;\n\u201cor rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I\nact for her: there\u2019s nobody else.\u201d\n\nI looked surprised.\n\n\u201cAh! you have not heard of Heathcliff\u2019s death, I see,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cHeathcliff dead!\u201d I exclaimed, astonished. \u201cHow long ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I\u2019ll\ntell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I\nnever dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you\ndon\u2019t expect them back for some time\u2014the young people?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\ndon\u2019t care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do\nyou good: you seem weary.\u201d\n\nShe hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph\nasking whether \u201cit warn\u2019t a crying scandal that she should have\nfollowers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o\u2019 t\u2019\nmaister\u2019s cellar! He fair shaamed to \u2019bide still and see it.\u201d\n\nShe did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\nreaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.\nAnd afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff\u2019s\nhistory. He had a \u201cqueer\u201d end, as she expressed it.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nI was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\nus, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine\u2019s sake. My first\ninterview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much\nsince our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for\ntaking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,\nand he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\nsitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to\nsee her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement;\nand, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other\narticles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered\nmyself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last\nlong. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable\nand restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the\ngarden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as\nspring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to\nquit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred\nquarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her\nsolitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often\nobliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the\nhouse to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his\napproach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or\naddressing him\u2014and though he was always as sullen and silent as\npossible\u2014after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable\nof letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and\nidleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he\nlived\u2014how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and\ndozing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?\u201d she once observed, \u201cor a\ncart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What\na blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if\nyou do, what is it about? But you can\u2019t speak to me!\u201d\n\nThen she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\nagain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s, perhaps, dreaming now,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe twitched his shoulder\nas Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don\u2019t\nbehave!\u201d I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\nfist, as if tempted to use it.\n\n\u201cI know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,\u201d she\nexclaimed, on another occasion. \u201cHe is afraid I shall laugh at him.\nEllen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and,\nbecause I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\nfool?\u201d\n\n\u201cWere not you naughty?\u201d I said; \u201canswer me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I was,\u201d she went on; \u201cbut I did not expect him to be so silly.\nHareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I\u2019ll try!\u201d\n\nShe placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\nmuttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.\n\n\u201cWell, I shall put it here,\u201d she said, \u201cin the table-drawer; and I\u2019m\ngoing to bed.\u201d\n\nThen she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But\nhe would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\ngreat disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\nand indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\nimproving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was\nat work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\nstationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\nbring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was\nthere, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\nlying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a\nmule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to\nsmoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of\nthe fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,\nas he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to\ndisregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting\nexpeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to\nher, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a\nlast resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was\nuseless.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had\nalmost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at\nthe commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the\nkitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter\ncut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach\nhome. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the\nfireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited\nCatherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room\nupstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business\nbelow, that she might accompany me.\n\nOn Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,\nin the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw\nsat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\nbeguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,\nvarying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered\nejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the\ndirection of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the\ngrate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my\nlight, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on\nher proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve found out,\nHareton, that I want\u2014that I\u2019m glad\u2014that I should like you to be my\ncousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.\u201d\n\nHareton returned no answer.\n\n\u201cHareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cGet off wi\u2019 ye!\u201d he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.\n\n\u201cLet me take that pipe,\u201d she said, cautiously advancing her hand and\nabstracting it from his mouth.\n\nBefore he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the\nfire. He swore at her and seized another.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou must listen to me first; and I can\u2019t speak\nwhile those clouds are floating in my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you go to the devil!\u201d he exclaimed, ferociously, \u201cand let me be!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she persisted, \u201cI won\u2019t: I can\u2019t tell what to do to make you talk\nto me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you\nstupid, I don\u2019t mean anything: I don\u2019t mean that I despise you. Come,\nyou shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall\nown me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall have naught to do wi\u2019 you and your mucky pride, and your\ndamned mocking tricks!\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll go to hell, body and soul,\nbefore I look sideways after you again. Side out o\u2019 t\u2019 gate, now, this\nminute!\u201d\n\nCatherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,\nand endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing\ntendency to sob.\n\n\u201cYou should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,\u201d I interrupted,\n\u201csince she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of\ngood: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.\u201d\n\n\u201cA companion!\u201d he cried; \u201cwhen she hates me, and does not think me fit\nto wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I\u2019d not be scorned for\nseeking her good-will any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!\u201d wept Cathy, no\nlonger disguising her trouble. \u201cYou hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff\ndoes, and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a damned liar,\u201d began Earnshaw: \u201cwhy have I made him angry, by\ntaking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at\nand despised me, and\u2014Go on plaguing me, and I\u2019ll step in yonder, and\nsay you worried me out of the kitchen!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you took my part,\u201d she answered, drying her eyes; \u201cand I\nwas miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you\nto forgive me: what can I do besides?\u201d\n\nShe returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened\nand scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely\nclenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct,\nmust have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that\nprompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant\nundecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The\nlittle rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took\nher former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head\nreprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered\u2014\u201cWell! what should I\nhave done, Ellen? He wouldn\u2019t shake hands, and he wouldn\u2019t look: I must\nshow him some way that I like him\u2014that I want to be friends.\u201d\n\nWhether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,\nfor some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did\nraise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.\n\nCatherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white\npaper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to\n\u201cMr. Hareton Earnshaw,\u201d she desired me to be her ambassadress, and\nconvey the present to its destined recipient.\n\n\u201cAnd tell him, if he\u2019ll take it, I\u2019ll come and teach him to read it\nright,\u201d she said; \u201cand, if he refuse it, I\u2019ll go upstairs, and never\ntease him again.\u201d\n\nI carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my\nemployer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.\nHe did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine\nleaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle\nof the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated\nherself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his\nrudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not\nsummon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her\nquestioning look, and her murmured petition.\n\n\u201cSay you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking\nthat little word.\u201d\n\nHe muttered something inaudible.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be my friend?\u201d added Catherine, interrogatively.\n\n\u201cNay, you\u2019ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,\u201d he answered;\n\u201cand the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t be my friend?\u201d she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and\ncreeping close up.\n\nI overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round\nagain, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of\nthe accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on\nboth sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.\n\nThe work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their\nposition had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.\nHe, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated\non the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his\nshoulder; and confounded at his favourite\u2019s endurance of her proximity:\nit affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that\nnight. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as\nhe solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with\ndirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day\u2019s\ntransactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.\n\n\u201cTak\u2019 these in to t\u2019 maister, lad,\u201d he said, \u201cand bide there. I\u2019s gang\nup to my own rahm. This hoile\u2019s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we\nmun side out and seearch another.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, Catherine,\u201d I said, \u201cwe must \u2018side out\u2019 too: I\u2019ve done my\nironing. Are you ready to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not eight o\u2019clock!\u201d she answered, rising unwillingly. \u201cHareton,\nI\u2019ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I\u2019ll bring some more\nto-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOny books that yah leave, I shall tak\u2019 into th\u2019 hahse,\u201d said Joseph,\n\u201cand it\u2019ll be mitch if yah find \u2019em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!\u201d\n\nCathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as\nshe passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture\nto say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,\nduring her earliest visits to Linton.\n\nThe intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered\ntemporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,\nand my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but\nboth their minds tending to the same point\u2014one loving and desiring to\nesteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed\u2014they contrived\nin the end to reach it.\n\nYou see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff\u2019s\nheart. But now, I\u2019m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes\nwill be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding\nday: there won\u2019t be a happier woman than myself in England!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOn the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his\nordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I\nspeedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,\nas heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,\nwhere she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I\nwent to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to\nclear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and\nthey were busy planning together an importation of plants from the\nGrange.\n\nI was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a\nbrief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph\u2019s\neye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of\nthem.\n\n\u201cThere! That will be all shown to the master,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cthe minute\nit is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such\nliberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head\nof it: see if we don\u2019t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more\nwit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten they were Joseph\u2019s,\u201d answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;\n\u201cbut I\u2019ll tell him I did it.\u201d\n\nWe always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress\u2019s post\nin making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine\nusually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I\npresently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than\nshe had in her hostility.\n\n\u201cNow, mind you don\u2019t talk with and notice your cousin too much,\u201d were\nmy whispered instructions as we entered the room. \u201cIt will certainly\nannoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he\u2019ll be mad at you both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to,\u201d she answered.\n\nThe minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in\nhis plate of porridge.\n\nHe dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went\non teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.\nI frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was\noccupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance\nevinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with\ndeep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at\nlast, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his\neye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed\nlook of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.\n\n\u201cIt is well you are out of my reach,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat fiend\npossesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal\neyes? Down with them! and don\u2019t remind me of your existence again. I\nthought I had cured you of laughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was me,\u201d muttered Hareton.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d demanded the master.\n\nHareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr.\nHeathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast\nand his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young\npeople prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further\ndisturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,\nrevealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage\ncommitted on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy\nand her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws\nworked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech\ndifficult to understand, he began:\u2014\n\n\u201cI mun hev\u2019 my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I\u2019d\nsarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I\u2019d lug my books up into t\u2019 garret,\nand all my bits o\u2019 stuff, and they sud hev\u2019 t\u2019 kitchen to theirseln;\nfor t\u2019 sake o\u2019 quietness. It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but\nI thowt I _could_ do that! But nah, shoo\u2019s taan my garden fro\u2019 me, and\nby th\u2019 heart, maister, I cannot stand it! Yah may bend to th\u2019 yoak an\nye will\u2014I noan used to \u2019t, and an old man doesn\u2019t sooin get used to new\nbarthens. I\u2019d rayther arn my bite an\u2019 my sup wi\u2019 a hammer in th\u2019 road!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, idiot!\u201d interrupted Heathcliff, \u201ccut it short! What\u2019s your\ngrievance? I\u2019ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may\nthrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s noan Nelly!\u201d answered Joseph. \u201cI sudn\u2019t shift for Nelly\u2014nasty ill\nnowt as shoo is. Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t\u2019 sowl o\u2019 nob\u2019dy! Shoo\nwer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her \u2019bout winking.\nIt\u2019s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that\u2019s witched our lad, wi\u2019 her\nbold een and her forrard ways\u2014till\u2014Nay! it fair brusts my heart! He\u2019s\nforgotten all I\u2019ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up\na whole row o\u2019 t\u2019 grandest currant-trees i\u2019 t\u2019 garden!\u201d and here he\nlamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and\nEarnshaw\u2019s ingratitude and dangerous condition.\n\n\u201cIs the fool drunk?\u201d asked Mr. Heathcliff. \u201cHareton, is it you he\u2019s\nfinding fault with?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pulled up two or three bushes,\u201d replied the young man; \u201cbut I\u2019m\ngoing to set \u2019em again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why have you pulled them up?\u201d said the master.\n\nCatherine wisely put in her tongue.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to plant some flowers there,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m the only\nperson to blame, for I wished him to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?\u201d\ndemanded her father-in-law, much surprised. \u201cAnd who ordered _you_ to\nobey her?\u201d he added, turning to Hareton.\n\nThe latter was speechless; his cousin replied\u2014\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t grudge a\nfew yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my\nland!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour land, insolent slut! You never had any,\u201d said Heathcliff.\n\n\u201cAnd my money,\u201d she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime\nbiting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cGet done, and begone!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Hareton\u2019s land, and his money,\u201d pursued the reckless thing.\n\u201cHareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!\u201d\n\nThe master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up,\neyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.\n\n\u201cIf you strike me, Hareton will strike you,\u201d she said; \u201cso you may as\nwell sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I\u2019ll strike him to\nhell,\u201d thundered Heathcliff. \u201cDamnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse\nhim against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen!\nI\u2019ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!\u201d\n\nHareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.\n\n\u201cDrag her away!\u201d he cried, savagely. \u201cAre you staying to talk?\u201d And he\napproached to execute his own command.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,\u201d said Catherine; \u201cand he\u2019ll\nsoon detest you as much as I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWisht! wisht!\u201d muttered the young man, reproachfully; \u201cI will not hear\nyou speak so to him. Have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t let him strike me?\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cCome, then,\u201d he whispered earnestly.\n\nIt was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.\n\n\u201cNow, _you_ go!\u201d he said to Earnshaw. \u201cAccursed witch! this time she\nhas provoked me when I could not bear it; and I\u2019ll make her repent it\nfor ever!\u201d\n\nHe had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,\nentreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff\u2019s black eyes\nflashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just\nworked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers\nrelaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed\nintently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a\nmoment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,\nsaid, with assumed calmness\u2014\u201cYou must learn to avoid putting me in a\npassion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and\nkeep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton\nEarnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I\u2019ll send him seeking his bread\nwhere he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.\nNelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!\u201d\n\nI led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the\nother followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.\nI had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he\nperceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of\nus, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that\nhe should not return before evening.\n\nThe two new friends established themselves in the house during his\nabsence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her\noffering a revelation of her father-in-law\u2019s conduct to his father. He\nsaid he wouldn\u2019t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if\nhe were the devil, it didn\u2019t signify; he would stand by him; and he\u2019d\nrather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.\nHeathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to\nmake her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak\nill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the\nmaster\u2019s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger\nthan reason could break\u2014chains, forged by habit, which it would be\ncruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in\navoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning\nHeathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to\nraise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don\u2019t believe she\nhas ever breathed a syllable, in the latter\u2019s hearing, against her\noppressor since.\n\nWhen this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as\nbusy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I\ncame in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so\nsoothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got\non. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long\nbeen proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of\nequal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off\nrapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been\nbred; and Catherine\u2019s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his\nindustry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added\nspirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same\nindividual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at\nWuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired\nand they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He\ncame upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a\nfull view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at\nhim. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless\nsight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light\nglowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with\nthe eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she\neighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither\nexperienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.\n\nThey lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps\nyou have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they\nare those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other\nlikeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of\nthe nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or\nnot. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at\nall times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were\nalert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose\nthis resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in\nevident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young\nman: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He\ntook the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then\nreturned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her\ncompanion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart\nalso, but he bid me sit still.\n\n\u201cIt is a poor conclusion, is it not?\u201d he observed, having brooded\na while on the scene he had just witnessed: \u201can absurd termination to\nmy violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two\nhouses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and\nwhen everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a\nslate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me;\nnow would be the precise time to revenge myself on their\nrepresentatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is\nthe use? I don\u2019t care for striking: I can\u2019t take the trouble to raise\nmy hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to\nexhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I\nhave lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle\nto destroy for nothing.\n\n\u201cNelly, there is a strange change approaching; I\u2019m in its shadow at\npresent. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly\nremember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the\nonly objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and\nthat appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won\u2019t\nspeak; and I don\u2019t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were\ninvisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves\nme differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I\u2019d\nnever see him again! You\u2019ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become\nso,\u201d he added, making an effort to smile, \u201cif I try to describe the\nthousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.\nBut you\u2019ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally\nsecluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.\n\n\u201cFive minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a\nhuman being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would\nhave been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first\nplace, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with\nher. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my\nimagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her\nto me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor,\nbut her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every\ntree\u2014filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object\nby day\u2014I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men\nand women\u2014my own features\u2014mock me with a resemblance. The entire world\nis a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I\nhave lost her! Well, Hareton\u2019s aspect was the ghost of my immortal\nlove; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,\nmy happiness, and my anguish\u2014\n\n\u201cBut it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\nknow why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\nbenefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it\npartly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\ntogether. I can give them no attention any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?\u201d I said, alarmed\nat his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,\nnor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;\nand, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on\ndark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a\nmonomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point\nhis wits were as sound as mine.\n\n\u201cI shall not know that till it comes,\u201d he said; \u201cI\u2019m only half\nconscious of it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no feeling of illness, have you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, Nelly, I have not,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cThen you are not afraid of death?\u201d I pursued.\n\n\u201cAfraid? No!\u201d he replied. \u201cI have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,\nnor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and\ntemperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and\nprobably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black\nhair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to\nremind myself to breathe\u2014almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is\nlike bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the\nslightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I\nnotice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one\nuniversal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties\nare yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so\nunwaveringly, that I\u2019m convinced it _will_ be reached\u2014and\n_soon_\u2014because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the\nanticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me;\nbut they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour\nwhich I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!\u201d\n\nHe began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I\nwas inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had\nturned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would\nend. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by\nlooks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it\nhimself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have\nconjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and\nat the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only\nfonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in\ncompany.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nFor some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at\nmeals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.\nHe had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing\nrather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed\nsufficient sustenance for him.\n\nOne night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and\nout at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning\nI found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet\nand warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the\ntwo dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After\nbreakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with\nmy work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled\nHareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and\narrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the\ninfluence of Joseph\u2019s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the\nspring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my\nyoung lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose\nroots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.\nHeathcliff was coming in. \u201cAnd he spoke to me,\u201d she added, with a\nperplexed countenance.\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d asked Hareton.\n\n\u201cHe told me to begone as fast as I could,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut he looked\nso different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cWhy, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing\u2014_very much_\nexcited, and wild, and glad!\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cNight-walking amuses him, then,\u201d I remarked, affecting a careless\nmanner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain\nthe truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would\nnot be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff\nstood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,\nhe had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of\nhis whole face.\n\n\u201cWill you have some breakfast?\u201d I said. \u201cYou must be hungry, rambling\nabout all night!\u201d I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not\nlike to ask directly.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he answered, averting his head, and speaking\nrather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the\noccasion of his good humour.\n\nI felt perplexed: I didn\u2019t know whether it were not a proper\nopportunity to offer a bit of admonition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it right to wander out of doors,\u201d I observed, \u201cinstead\nof being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I\ndaresay you\u2019ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the\nmatter with you now!\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but what I can bear,\u201d he replied; \u201cand with the greatest\npleasure, provided you\u2019ll leave me alone: get in, and don\u2019t annoy me.\u201d\n\nI obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d I reflected to myself, \u201cwe shall have a fit of illness. I cannot\nconceive what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nThat noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate\nfrom my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,\u201d he remarked, in allusion to my\nmorning\u2019s speech; \u201cand I\u2019m ready to do justice to the food you give\nme.\u201d\n\nHe took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the\ninclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the\ntable, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We\nsaw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,\nand Earnshaw said he\u2019d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we\nhad grieved him some way.\n\n\u201cWell, is he coming?\u201d cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut he\u2019s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased\nindeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he\nbid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of\nanybody else.\u201d\n\nI set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he\nre-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same\nunnatural\u2014it was unnatural\u2014appearance of joy under his black brows; the\nsame bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of\nsmile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,\nbut as a tight-stretched cord vibrates\u2014a strong thrilling, rather than\ntrembling.\n\nI will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I\nexclaimed\u2014\u201cHave you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look\nuncommonly animated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere should good news come from to me?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m animated with\nhunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dinner is here,\u201d I returned; \u201cwhy won\u2019t you get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it now,\u201d he muttered, hastily: \u201cI\u2019ll wait till supper.\nAnd, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other\naway from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this\nplace to myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there some new reason for this banishment?\u201d I inquired. \u201cTell me\nwhy you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I\u2019m\nnot putting the question through idle curiosity, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are putting the question through very idle curiosity,\u201d he\ninterrupted, with a laugh. \u201cYet I\u2019ll answer it. Last night I was on the\nthreshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my\neyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you\u2019d better go!\nYou\u2019ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain\nfrom prying.\u201d\n\nHaving swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed\nthan ever.\n\nHe did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on\nhis solitude; till, at eight o\u2019clock, I deemed it proper, though\nunsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning\nagainst the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was\nturned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the\nroom was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so\nstill, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was\ndistinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or\nthrough the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an\nejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced\nshutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.\n\n\u201cMust I close this?\u201d I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not\nstir.\n\nThe light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I\ncannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those\ndeep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me,\nnot Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle\nbend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.\n\n\u201cYes, close it,\u201d he replied, in his familiar voice. \u201cThere, that is\npure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick,\nand bring another.\u201d\n\nI hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph\u2014\u201cThe\nmaster wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.\u201d For I\ndared not go in myself again just then.\n\nJoseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it\nback immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining\nthat Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till\nmorning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to\nhis ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its\nwindow, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get\nthrough; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,\nof which he had rather we had no suspicion.\n\n\u201cIs he a ghoul or a vampire?\u201d I mused. I had read of such hideous\nincarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him\nin infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost\nthrough his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to\nthat sense of horror. \u201cBut where did he come from, the little dark\nthing, harboured by a good man to his bane?\u201d muttered Superstition, as\nI dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary\nmyself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my\nwaking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim\nvariations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I\ncan remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of\ndictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton\nabout it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we\nwere obliged to content ourselves with the single word, \u201cHeathcliff.\u201d\nThat came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you\u2019ll read, on his\nheadstone, only that, and the date of his death.\n\nDawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as\nsoon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his\nwindow. There were none. \u201cHe has stayed at home,\u201d I thought, \u201cand he\u2019ll\nbe all right to-day.\u201d I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my\nusual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the\nmaster came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of\ndoors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.\n\nOn my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were\nconversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute\ndirections concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and\nturned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,\neven more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in\nthe place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.\nHe drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at\nthe opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up\nand down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest\nthat he stopped breathing during half a minute together.\n\n\u201cCome now,\u201d I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, \u201ceat and\ndrink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t notice me, and yet he smiled. I\u2019d rather have seen him gnash\nhis teeth than smile so.\n\n\u201cMr. Heathcliff! master!\u201d I cried, \u201cdon\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake, stare as if\nyou saw an unearthly vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake, shout so loud,\u201d he replied. \u201cTurn round, and\ntell me, are we by ourselves?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d was my answer; \u201cof course we are.\u201d\n\nStill, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a\nsweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the\nbreakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.\n\nNow, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded\nhim alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two\nyards\u2019 distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both\npleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet\nraptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The\nfancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with\nunwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned\naway. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if\nhe stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he\nstretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched\nbefore they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their\naim.\n\nI sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention\nfrom its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,\nasking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his\nmeals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn\u2019t wait: I might set\nthe things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house,\nslowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the\ngate.\n\nThe hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to\nrest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after\nmidnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room\nbeneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and\ndescended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a\nhundred idle misgivings.\n\nI distinguished Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s step, restlessly measuring the floor,\nand he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a\ngroan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was\nthe name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or\nsuffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and\nearnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to\nwalk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his\nreverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and\nbegan to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected.\nHe opened the door immediately, and said\u2014\u201cNelly, come here\u2014is it\nmorning? Come in with your light.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is striking four,\u201d I answered. \u201cYou want a candle to take upstairs:\nyou might have lit one at this fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t wish to go upstairs,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in, and kindle _me_ a\nfire, and do anything there is to do about the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,\u201d I replied,\ngetting a chair and the bellows.\n\nHe roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his\nheavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for\ncommon breathing between.\n\n\u201cWhen day breaks I\u2019ll send for Green,\u201d he said; \u201cI wish to make some\nlegal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,\nand while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to\nleave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from\nthe face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d I interposed. \u201cLet your will be\na while: you\u2019ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I\nnever expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at\npresent, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own\nfault. The way you\u2019ve passed these three last days might knock up a\nTitan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at\nyourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are\nhollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger\nand going blind with loss of sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,\u201d he replied. \u201cI assure\nyou it is through no settled designs. I\u2019ll do both, as soon as I\npossibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water\nrest within arms\u2019 length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then\nI\u2019ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my\ninjustices, I\u2019ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I\u2019m too\nhappy; and yet I\u2019m not happy enough. My soul\u2019s bliss kills my body, but\ndoes not satisfy itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy, master?\u201d I cried. \u201cStrange happiness! If you would hear me\nwithout being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you\nhappier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cGive it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,\u201d I said, \u201cthat from the time you were\nthirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and\nprobably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You\nmust have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have\nspace to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one\u2014some\nminister of any denomination, it does not matter which\u2014to explain it,\nand show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how\nunfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before\nyou die?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,\u201d he said, \u201cfor you remind me of\nthe manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the\nchurchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please,\naccompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys\nmy directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor\nneed anything be said over me.\u2014I tell you I have nearly attained _my_\nheaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that\nmeans, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?\u201d I\nsaid, shocked at his godless indifference. \u201cHow would you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t do that,\u201d he replied: \u201cif they did, you must have me\nremoved secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,\nthat the dead are not annihilated!\u201d\n\nAs soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired\nto his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph\nand Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,\nwith a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody\nwith him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and\nmanner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be\nhis companion alone.\n\n\u201cI believe you think me a fiend,\u201d he said, with his dismal laugh:\n\u201csomething too horrible to live under a decent roof.\u201d Then turning to\nCatherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he\nadded, half sneeringly,\u2014\u201cWill _you_ come, chuck? I\u2019ll not hurt you. No!\nto you I\u2019ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who\nwon\u2019t shrink from my company! By God! she\u2019s relentless. Oh, damn it!\nIt\u2019s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear\u2014even mine.\u201d\n\nHe solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his\nchamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard\nhim groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter;\nbut I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When\nhe came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found\nit locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be\nleft alone; so the doctor went away.\n\nThe following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till\nday-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed\nthe master\u2019s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He\ncannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He\nmust either be up or out. But I\u2019ll make no more ado, I\u2019ll go boldly and\nlook.\n\nHaving succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to\nunclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them\naside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there\u2014laid on his back. His eyes\nmet mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I\ncould not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with\nrain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice,\nflapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no\nblood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I\ncould doubt no more: he was dead and stark!\n\nI hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I\ntried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,\nlife-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would\nnot shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and\nsharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I\ncried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but\nresolutely refused to meddle with him.\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 divil\u2019s harried off his soul,\u201d he cried, \u201cand he may hev\u2019 his\ncarcass into t\u2019 bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked \u2019un he\nlooks, girning at death!\u201d and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I\nthought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly\ncomposing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and\nreturned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were\nrestored to their rights.\n\nI felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred\nto former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton,\nthe most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by\nthe corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand,\nand kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from\ncontemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs\nnaturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.\n\nMr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master\ndied. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four\ndays, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he\ndid not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange\nillness, not the cause.\n\nWe buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.\nEarnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,\ncomprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had\nlet it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with\na streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould\nhimself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion\nmounds\u2014and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,\nif you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are\nthose who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and\neven within this house. Idle tales, you\u2019ll say, and so say I. Yet that\nold man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on \u2019em looking out\nof his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:\u2014and an odd\nthing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one\nevening\u2014a dark evening, threatening thunder\u2014and, just at the turn of\nthe Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs\nbefore him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were\nskittish, and would not be guided.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter, my little man?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t\u2019 nab,\u201d he blubbered,\n\u201cun\u2019 I darnut pass \u2019em.\u201d\n\nI saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him\ntake the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from\nthinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard\nhis parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don\u2019t like being out\nin the dark now; and I don\u2019t like being left by myself in this grim\nhouse: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift\nto the Grange.\n\n\u201cThey are going to the Grange, then?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Mrs. Dean, \u201cas soon as they are married, and that will\nbe on New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who will live here then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep\nhim company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?\u201d I observed.\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Lockwood,\u201d said Nelly, shaking her head. \u201cI believe the dead\nare at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.\u201d\n\nAt that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.\n\n\u201c_They_ are afraid of nothing,\u201d I grumbled, watching their approach\nthrough the window. \u201cTogether, they would brave Satan and all his\nlegions.\u201d\n\nAs they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look\nat the moon\u2014or, more correctly, at each other by her light\u2014I felt\nirresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance\ninto the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my\nrudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;\nand so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his\nfellow-servant\u2019s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised\nme for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his\nfeet.\n\nMy walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the\nkirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even\nin seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and\nslates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof,\nto be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.\n\nI sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next\nthe moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton\u2019s\nonly harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff\u2019s\nstill bare.\n\nI lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths\nfluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind\nbreathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever\nimagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WUTHERING HEIGHTS ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

The invalidity or\nunenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the\nremaining provisions.\n\n1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\nDefect you cause.\n\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n",
